Much more crucial in baking than in cooking.', 'Title: Warped on first use!; Content: The first time we ever used one of these pans, it warped terribly in the oven. It had been in the preheated oven for 5 minutes when we heard a loud bang and saw that it had warped. The pans seem extremely sturdy out of the box and I was excited to use them but sadly the quality is just not there.', 'Title: Fraud, selling a lower quality product that does not match the pictures. I\\'m very unhappy.; Content: I ordered these specifically due to the heavy duty rack, shown with a thick outer wire and integrated feet in multiple images. The racks that arrived are super cheap and not only are of a different design, but have no larger gauge wire around the outside edge of the rack, and are completely made from much thinner wire than the product they are displaying. The feet of the rack are not in the outer edge either, they are bent out of the thin inner wires. They even describe \"Smooth roll edges make it super comfortable to hold and transfer, dense to prevent food from falling through.\" yet these racks have no such edges. I can\\'t speak to the quality of the tray, but I will not keep a product that was a bait and switch. Immediately returned, buyer beware!', 'Title: Garbage! Dont waste your money; Content: People said itll go up to 400deg without warping. I kid you not, the oven got to 265F and we heard the \"pop\" of the warp. Thats pathetic, for something that costs as much as it does, I would expect these to last to a higher temp. We are giving it some time to see if it keeps repeating, but we may end up returning.', 'Title: Thin, warp easy; Content: Cons: Warped the first time they went into the oven. Very unsturdy material. Impossible to clean without damaging. Pure garbage don’t buy these!', 'Title: warps; Content: I heard a loud noise bang coming from my oven. The baking sheet warped in the heat sending the cookies flying.', 'Title: SMALLER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS; Content: i will be returning this item. the overall dimensions are actually shy of 16\"x12\" AND the inside dimension, the actual flat surface of the sheet measures to approximately 15\"x11\". So in other words, if you are trying to use one of the silicone mats with this sheet, I would strongly suggest double checking the sizes against each another.', \"Title: Low Quality - Prone to Warping; Content: I don't know the exact manufacturing process they used for the pans, probably a piece of sheet metal pressed into a mold. The pan is very prone to warping when heated up. Within 1 or 2 minutes after I put what I'm cooking in the oven, the pan literally bends upward at two of the corners diagonally. If you were to make cookies with it or something that needs to stay flat, you're going to have problems.\", 'Title: Warped at 450 degrees; Content: The first time I used these was to bake pretzels at 450 degrees for 10 minutes. They warped, a nasty twist an no longer lay flat. A waste of money.', \"Title: They DO warp; Content: Very disappointed. Used them for the first time today and they warped. I thought they were sturdy....boy, was I wrong. If you don't care about warping, go ahead and get them. I am not happy.\", \"Title: Absolute Junk; Content: These pans can't handle heat. one use in the oven and they have warped and no longer sit flat. likely due to the lack of a rolled lip around the edge and then metal pick another set than this - trust me\", 'Title: Warped the first time I used them.; Content: Pans warped the first time I used them.

First time I used in a 350° oven, it twisted and lifted up on one side.', \"Title: It twisted in the oven on the first bake; Content: The pans and racks are beautiful.

The pans will suddenly warp in the oven, almost caused a grease fire inside my oven. Would not suggest at all.', \"Title: Pans Warp; Content: Don't understand all the good reviews. Baking Sheets warps badly after first use. Another person has put a picture of them warping, that is exactly how they look in the oven.\", \"Title: NOT Heavy Duty, and possibly not even Stainless Steel; Content: It is shocking to me that this product has 4.5 stars. The only good thing about them is that the racks do fit inside the pans. There are no manufacturers marks on this product. Guessing they are ashamed of it. The metal is thin and flimsy compared to an old baking pan I have. These will work for cooking bacon in the oven - main reason for buying - so I will not return them. (also because I'm old and lazy!) But if you really are a Baker, these will not satisfy you. It's a shame we can't trust Amazon reviews anymore.\", \"Title: Weird size; Content: These seem to be good quality, but they are not standard size half sheet. They are smaller. Wife ordered them because our old ones were losing their finish, but I don't like the fact that they are an odd ball size. Can't even fit a pack of bacon on them for oven cooking, so what good are they??\", 'Title: warps and hard to clean; Content: I used this sheet once. Halfway through baking time I heard a loud pop and when i opened the oven, the sheet had warped and the food jostled. It went back to shape after cooling. Also, it was impossible to get the stains off even with Bon Ami.', \"Title: Bends in the oven; Content: It's a great price for what you get, but unfortunately the pans pop into a bent shape as they heat up in the oven which is not acceptable. Important to share with other possible buyers. I wouldn't have if I had known.\", 'Title: May want to keep looking for a quality pan; Content: For the price I was expecting something of higher quality. These pans came dented right out of the box from where the cooling rack sits inside. After one use I’m already dealing with what looks like rust even tho I dried them well.', 'Title: warps easily; Content: Used one time to bake a few cookies at 375 degrees. While in the oven, at temperature, both ends of the pan warped up. This creates some potential for slippage when handling the hot tray. After cool down aout 80% of the warpage went away. I guess it is technically useable but it will go the the back of my cupboard and eventually tossed out.

They fit, but I wouldn’t buy them again and suggest you pass on these...', 'Title: pan warps under heat; Content: often pan will warp and therefore spills happen in the oven! Not sure why, it does go back to flat after cools down, but maybe too thin. Beware, these are cheap!', 'Title: Cheap!; Content: These cookie sheets were purchased to replace one that I had for years but they were not even close to as nice as my commercial sheet. These seem very cheap and I don’t expect them to hold up well. Also, everything sticks!', \"Title: They're shiny; Content: I thought these sheets would be more sturdy, heavy. Not at all. They bend and warp in the heat.\", \"Title: Rather flimsy. Do not recommend; Content: 1. I wasn't aware that these were wider than my old sheets. I can't fit two side-by-side on the same rack of my oven. 2. They warp when heated up and don't sit flat.\", \"Title: This does not keep it shine after use. Also warping is a HUGE problem.; Content: I liked the high ridges on the sheet pan, however, it didn't retain its shine after usage, scratches easily. I tried to make a galette, but because of warping the juice of my fruit spilled out onto my sheet. I would like to return this if possible. Very disappointed.\", 'Title: Not good under high heat....; Content: Under high heat the pan warps. All the olive oil will run to the low side and not cook everything evenly. 400 degrees plus.', \"Title: Warps when heated and hard to clean; Content: I've unfortunately found these to warp when heated, which is the least I can ask for for a baking sheet :( Stainless steel sheets are also quite a bit harder to clean. (Not to the fault of the product.)\", 'Title: Disappointed; Content: While these are sturdy durable and easy to clean they warp when in the oven. Bad news as one corner flips up and sends food flying.', 'Title: Looked too good to be true; Content: Used it for the first time in my oven and it bent/twisted where now 2 corners are tilted up and the other ones down, weirdest thing I’ve ever seen. Material is super thin I thought it would be thicker', \"Title: Warped; Content: Warped the second time it was used. Obviously can't handle high heat. I will stick to using them with the racks for bacon.\", \"Title: Well I am going to keep them but. . .; Content: First time I used them was to bake some cookies at 350 degrees and they warped in the oven. It didn't hurt the cookies but it is annoying as I believe it said they were oven safe up to 400 or 425 which I take to mean that they won't warp. I do like the cooling racks. They returned to normal shape once they cooled. I just can't seem to find baking sheets that won't warp. I can't see how these will stand the test of time when warping every time I use them. I have used them two more times for baking at 350 and they warped each time. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money on them. So if you want non warping baking sheets look elsewhere.\", 'Title: They get the job done; Content: I bought these pans to make oven baked “fried chicken”. They stick horrible even with nonstick spray and I have to use a Brillo pad to get it off. Lots of elbow grease! They are thinner than most pans but they don’t bend. Not the best pans I could have gotten but they do get the job done. I should have paid a little more for better pans. But these will do for now.', 'Title: Item Smaller than Standard Half Sheet Pan; Content: The pans and racks look good. However, they are smaller that a standard half sheet pan and matching rack. Also, the metal the pans are made of is much thinner than standard sheet pans that I have gotten from AceMart. I would be afraid to put anything heay on one of these pans without reinforcement.', \"Title: Good for cooking not baking; Content: So these have been great for pan bakes or green beans, etc. But not for baking. The cookies don't cook or rise properly. I've literally used these cookie sheets in the same oven as my other cookie sheet. Cookies on the other one rise, brown, and cook through. On these sheets, they for some reason don't rise, get spludgy, and end up raw on the bottom. It's weird. So I'll be using them for cooking only from now on.\", 'Title: Not a half sheet pan!; Content: Nice heavy-duty stainless steel pans, but not as large as I had hoped. These are not a half-sheet pans: just a bit shorter and narrower, which puts them awkwardly in between the quarter and half-sheet size. Should have read the dimensions more carefully! Also a little on the shallow side, especially when using them with the rack in, would be nice if they were another 1/4 to 1/2 inch taller.', 'Title: Cheap and shiny; Content: inexpensive thin cooking sheets,warps a lot under higher heat-was cooking bacon in the oven and the amount of warp almost dumped all the grease into my oven', 'Title: Nice but thin; Content: The baking sheets are all right. They work as expected but warp / tilt when hot. If you have something liquid like greasy bacon, the grease will pool all opposite corners.', 'Title: Was nice then warped; Content: Haven’t had mine long and I only hand wash (don’t own a dishwasher) yet somehow one cookie sheet is already warped. Now, as the temperature changes in the oven, the sheet will spontaneously pop as the bend changes direction, sending all my cookies to one corner :(', 'Title: Bends in the oven; Content: It works in a tovala. But they bend like hell when in the oven.', 'Title: Eh....; Content: These look great and feel durable. But within 5 minutes of being in the oven they warped. Not idea for making my macarons.', 'Title: Flex/warp when hot; Content: These pans warp/flex at oven temperatures of 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Not too bad otherwise but they are flimsy at higher temps. I have a photo but don’t allow Amazon to access my camera roll and can’t upload a single file.', 'Title: Not for oven use!; Content: All the reviews said that these trays are oven safe, they absolutely are not! I tried to heat a piece of fish at 350 degrees in the oven and the tray warped to an almost comical level. They look great, and will work terrific as a cooling tray, but cannot be used in the oven.', 'Title: what i needed; Content: used to professional pans but these will be just what I need for home use although I am a professional and may beat them up a little bit LOL', 'Title: Warps when hot; Content: These pans seem good at first but they warp when they get hot. They are also very very hard to get clean.', 'Title: Baking Sheets; Content: The pans are much smaller than I thought they would be', 'Title: Deform under baking temperatures and sharp edges; Content: I deeply gashed my finger simply picking a pan up because the rolled edges are poorly done. Be careful with this! They are cheap so I might keep them. Not sure. I may Dremel or sand the edges to avoid further bleeding. Additionally these pans bend and deform above 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but you get what you pay for.', 'Title: Helps to brown what you oven bake.; Content: Made some chicken tenders with an egg wash and spiced panko. The tenders browned up nicely. Lost a star because wife broiled a ham steak using the set. The melted fat fell away into the pan (good). Sadly the pan warped. On the bright side we laid the pan on a flat surface (cook-top) and it straightened itself out as it cooled down. Do not use the set on broil.', 'Title: The best baking sheets.

The cooling racks are sturdy and worked like a charm for cooling cookies.', 'Title: Good value; Content: So far so good, but with foreign metals including “stainless” you don’t know the true quality of it until years down the road, and foreign (Asian/Chinese) metals are not on the same par as USA/Eu/Japan. However these are just baking trays. They are a little lighter gauge than I care for so they are a bit prone to warping during heat-cool cycles but have returned to original thus far. Overall good value and would/will buy again.', 'Title: Exceeded Expectations...; Content: When I first received these baking sheets, I was surprised by their weight. For the price, these are the heaviest baking sheets I\\'ve ever had. So far I\\'ve used these to bake various things in the oven and they\\'ve been great. At 325-375, typically with the convection fan going, they\\'ve yet to \"pop\" and twist as they were heating or cooling, like other baking sheets I\\'ve owned. I typically use aluminum foil to line them and after a soapy hot water soaking, they usually wipe clean with a sponge. I\\'ve yet to need to use scotch brite. So far, for the price, they\\'ve been great. The only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars is that I don\\'t know how they will be over time.', \"Title: Worth it!; Content: These are definitely worth the money and a good set of pans! While they are not huge they are definitely a good size and a good quality stainless steel. I have had the pans for a few months now and they have held up really well! They are super easy to clean, even when I've had burnt on stuck on messes from things like bacon, a little steel wool and it scrubs clean. The racks are also not hard to clean. I have not had any problems with warping until yesterday when I had the oven on about 405° and I was using the pans WITHOUT the rack and the pans did warp some but came right back down after cooling off. I have used the pans several times WITH the racks in and had no problems with warping and that was with high temperatures, but without the rack they don't seem to fare as well so I gave 4 stars. Definitely worth purchasing!\", 'Title: Not bad for the price but would opt for a sturdier baking sheet next time.; Content: At 400 degrees the pans would warp but once cooled down it will get back to original shape. Maybe if it was a little thicker it wouldn’t do this. I think when I warps it doesn’t cook evenly. It is tough to clean unless you put foil over it.', 'Title: Warped at 450; Content: Warped at 450 degrees but not by much. Works as intended for wings! Really shiny but looks like once you stain it will be hard to clean, like most pans anyway.', 'Title: Great for toaster oven; Content: I’ve learned to just line these with aluminum foil, to avoid the crazy scrubbing. But they do the job especially with the wire rack.', 'Title: Good for regular use; Content: Good baking sheets, great size but always make sure they are well greased or sprayed with non stick spray. It is difficult to get grease off. But in general, pretty good.', 'Title: Weekly use; Content: I use these every week. They bend in the oven slightly making a loud noise. But still work perfectly.', 'Title: Temporary warping; Content: Pans are this and prone to warping if using in rotation.', \"Title: A Great Addition to Any Kitchen!; Content: My wife and I have wanted a wire rack and baking sheet set for years but, for some reason, just never purchased it. We took a cooking class recently that lit a fire to finally purchase a set. The value of this set surprised us and we immediately purchased it. This set is amazing. We had a wire rack for baking, but it was large and didn't fit in the dishwasher so we would rarely use it because it was a pain to wash by hand and make sure everything was off the wire. This set is a perfect size to fit in the dishwasher and the refrigerator so we have used them many times already, even in instances where we wouldn't actually need their full functionality but just because we now owned them. Coming in a two pack is great. Two sets give you the ability to put raw meat, say freshly out of a marinade or breading, on one rack to wait for cooking while you can use the other rack for the cooked meat without having to wash in between. The pans easily nest inside of each other so two pans barely take up more space than one. These pans and racks have changed the way we work around our kitchen so much that we're not quite sure how we lived without them so long. We highly recommend them! One clarification I would like to add is: I would actually rate the durability as a 5 with an * by it. Everything is solid stainless steel so durability is 5/5. BUT. Everything is solid stainless steel. That means the 4 legs of the stainless steel wire rack will scratch the pan. It was a little sad to see the scratches start to form on the pans and take away from their bright & shiny luster, but the pans are solid stainless steel so it's not a coating that is being scratched off and the pans retain 100% of their 5/5 integrity and usefulness.\", \"Title: Standard baking trays with matched racks. GREAT for searing meat under a broiler.; Content: PRO: -good quality finish on both the racks and trays, has withstood multiple runs through the dishwasher without showing any rusting or pitting. -nice rolled lip, providing good rigidity all the way around the tray. -racks fit perfectly within the trays -pack of 2 for less than some competitors would charge for 1!!! -uncoated stainless steel means you can be REALLY rough when scrubbing, don't worry about damaging the finish. -Dishwasher safe, whether or not the manufacturer claims they are. Mine have been through the wash plenty of times without any ill effects. CON (honestly none, just confirming what I read in other reviews and giving my thoughts): -made of fairly thin (albeit high-quality) stainless sheet steel. If you expose it to very high heat, it may warp, but should warp back if allowed to cool slowly. Mine have been used under my broiler on high without any ill-effects. -because the metal is thin, I wouldn't suggest using these for an extremely heavy roast or bake. They're great for up to 12 or maybe 15 lbs on a single sheet, but I wouldn't recommend more than that. Don't make a huge turkey on these (but duh, they aren't meant for that) -pans are uncoated, and that's both a positive and negative. It means you can be very rough with scrubbing them clean. but it also means that anything with fats or carbohydrates is very likely to burn onto the pan and be difficult to remove. I suggest putting a layer of aluminum foil over the pans when using them, but a silpat would work great too. 5/5 would recommend to a friend, will probably buy more.\", \"Title: Easy to clean heavy duty super nice; Content: I absolutely love these baking sheets they are heavy duty very nice quality easy to clean better than the ones I've had in the past\", \"Title: Perfect; Content: These pans are much better than I expected. The heft and feel of them is pleasing and gives me confidence that they won't rust away and will serve me for many years to come!\", 'Title: Good buy; Content: Great. Very happy with these. The racks clean nicely in the top level of dishwasher. The pans can be easily cleaned with SOS pads under running water. Sometimes I put parchment paper extending under and beyond, the aluminum foil I fold up on the sides like a little box underneath when I bake the bacon on the racks. Easy to almost no cleanup for the baking sheets.', 'Title: Multipurpose and Most Useful; Content: These work very well for my purposes. I mainly use them in tandem for drying fish that has come out of a brine. Plenty of room for good-sized fish. I also use the racks for cooling baked goods such as pies and cakes. I have read comments about the mirror-finish scratching on the baking pan surface...really? They are baking pans and not ornaments. My respectful suggestion is to either cook with them or hang them on the wall (ha-ha). These clean easily with warm water and soap.', \"Title: For Wings; Content: Great piece of hardware for wings. Just pop em in the oven at 410F for 30min then flip them, do another 30min and then flip them again during the final flip you determine how crispy you want them and if you want to keep going. Usually between 2 and 3 flips they are crispy enough for me and they don't even need to be lathered in oil/fat. Just season an voila. Not easy to clean. Need to be soaked in water over night.\", \"Title: Nice baking pans; Content: I really like the shine on these baking sheets. So, far I've only used them once so I can't comment on how durable they will be in the future. The price was great and you get two. The cooling rack fits inside the pan very nicely and because of that they don't take up a lot of storage space. They were packaged in bubble wrap to keep them from being scratched.\", \"Title: Very nice quality; Content: I like these baking sheets. They are sturdy and easy to clean. I bought them for my husband who enjoys cooking but he learned real quick that you need to use a cooking spray on them to prevent sticking. No big deal though. It only took heating up some tater tots without the spray to find out how important the spray is. Although I cannot get the pan to return to it's spotless original condition, the spots where the food stuck are not that noticeable.\", \"Title: Cheaper than a Blackstone Griddle!; Content: Odd headline? I didn't buy these to bake with. I actually bought these for cooking on top of the grill. Makes for easy marinating, and direct from fridge to grille for things like kebobs, grilled veggies, etc. From there it's direct to sink+dishwasher for cleaning. So far, they've lasted all summer. They're very sturdy for baking, but for my purpose, they sometimes will warp due to temperature differential - they straighten out every time afterward so far.\", 'Title: Used for cooking chicken; Content: I use this to cook a lot of chicken at one time. Works perfectly and allows the fat to drip down away from the chicken.', \"Title: Great Cleanability; Content: I wasn't sure about the mirror finish but these pans are great. They clean so easily and using a blue sponge they don't scratch! We cooked bacon on it and after letting the bacon drips soak for just a few minutes the drips literally slid off with water spraying. Absolutely no scrubbing.\", 'Title: Nice pans; Content: Surprised at the quality and durability of these pans. Needed a couple for various cooking needs and bacon was my first experience. I did line the bottom with foil but the a bacon did great in the oven and clean up was a breeze. Also the pans did not warp. Great price! Would buy again.', 'Title: Awesome baking trays; Content: I have bought 4 sets of these so far, 1 for me and 3 friends. They are very sturdy and easy to clean, I dont have a dishwasher so I imagine even easier. Perfect for cooking bacon, no spatter and bacon cooks flat, no shrivel. So many other uses as well. Very pleased with this product!', 'Title: Great value for the price.; Content: I like the grids. I use them for BBQ to hold chicken strips a d in the oven for frozen french fries. Definitely stainless steel and clean up ok with a bit of scrubbing and soaking. The trays will be good for cookies. I used them for French fries and they spotted a bit but no real issue.', \"Title: Excellent quality at extremely reasonable price; Content: The sheets are nice enough to use as serving trays: beautifully polished steel and sturdy enough not to bend or twist. The racks are useful as cooling racks as well as for baking. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.\", 'Title: Perfect for June Oven; Content: I recently purchased a new June countertop oven. These baking sheets are the perfect size to fit side-by-side in the oven for times when I am cooking two different things requiring different cooking times… or when I’m just cooking a smaller amount of something. They clean up easily and the racks have been great when roasting turkey and chicken breasts.', 'Title: Super Heavy Duty; Content: Both the baking sheets and the racks are heavy duty. These are not flimsy, clean up nicely in the dishwasher and the racks are far more durable than I anticipated. Bought two of these, but will definitely be buying more.', 'Title: Warps in oven, pops and throws food around in oven; Content: First time using, the sheets warped inside and popped all the food around inside the oven. See pictures.', \"Title: Flimsy; Content: For the price paid, I am rather disappointed in the heftiness and stability of these cooling racks. I still have them, but in all honesty, don't even know what I'll use them for ... maybe drying greeting cards that I make?? And I ordered a new one from Pampered Chef .\", 'Title: Less than 18 X 13\"; Content: These are not 18 X 13 inches as advertised. In fact the base of the pan is less than 17 X 12. Because of this they don\\'t stack with most other standard baking sheets. Another consequence of their undersized dimensions is that my Amazon silicone sheets don\\'t fit in these baking sheets.', \"Title: pan terribly warps in oven; Content: This pan is not thick, not sturdy at all! The pan warp in the oven with 450F baking. your food will just slide to one corner and can't get heated averagely. So basically, you dont do any baking with it. Just dont worth the money at all.\", 'Title: DO NOT BUY; Content: These pans are horrible. They are not sturdy at all. I had bacon wrapped chicken tenders in the oven and the pan was warping and threw a couple in the bottom of the oven. Do not waste your money on these pieces of junk.', \"Title: Warps easily; Content: Warped on the first use, both of them. The racks are ok but the pans are sadly headed to the landfill. Spend a little more and get something you'll be happy with for years.\", \"Title: Worst sheetpan I've ever used; Content: These sheet pans warp every time they're in the oven. You will hear a loud snapping sound. It is also smaller than other baking sheets so my silicone cookie sheets do not fit on it. Would return but it is past the return date.\", 'Title: WARPED!; Content: First use in the oven on 350 and it warped. Poor quality.', 'Title: Terrible…not for use in oven!; Content: This pan should not be called a “baking” pan, since it warped, with a loud sound 5 minutes after placing it in the oven, then quickly returning to it’s original shape when cooled down…shiny and pretty, but completely useless in the oven!', 'Title: CRAP; Content: Junk!! They are twisted up when heated in the oven!', 'Title: Pan Warps After First Use; Content: Was excited to put these bad boys to use, & hyped about the deal; however, you get what ya pay for. The sheet and rack both warped after the first use on both. Pay the extra money for a decent product.', 'Title: Warps in the Oven; Content: Purchased these pans for macarons and the pans warp in the oven under 300 degrees which would cause the macarons to become lopsided. Not ideal for macarons', 'Title: They’d be perfect if they didn’t warp in the oven and make a mess. Very disappointed.; Content: Warps in oven.', 'Title: WARPS ON THE FIRST USE!; Content: Absolute garbage. Made frozen french fries one time and it WARPED.', 'Title: Not good quality; Content: 400 degrees Pan is twisted Not too happy about it', 'Title: Warped on first use :(; Content: I\\'ve only used one of these thus far, but was disappointed that it was warped when I pulled it out after first use, one corner was 1/2\" off the counter. It returned to flat sometime later. Also, it wouldn\\'t clean completely after only one use (cooked bacon in the oven), with some discoloring along the inside edges. I suggest you spend a bit more money and get something better.', 'Title: Mirror finish is really shiny; Content: I made chicken wings on these the other night. First I washed them - they did fine in the dishwasher, no problems. The mirror shine though - wow that’s shiny. Until you cook on it. I put wings on the rack and cooked them at 350° in my smoker for about an hour. The mirror finish got a bit rough and the drippings were hard to get off the bottom. Overall they’re ok - not perfect but better than other pans I’ve seen', 'Title: Pass on these; Content: These pans are extremely flimsy and cheap. Was really dissapointed when we used them for the first time. Maybe they will magically transform with heat but I doubt it.', 'Title: The baking sheet is great unless you plan to bake with it.; Content: The pan distorts in the oven. 2 corners will pop out of alignment when heated. I cannot recommend this product unless you solely intend to use it as a drying rack.', 'Title: Poor quality; Content: I’ve used the pans twice now. This time the one has warped and no longer sits flat. Rather difficult to use the pan. Not worth the purchase.', \"Title: will bent on high heat; Content: put some roasted potatoes at 400°F and the sheet just bent. now it's uneven. would only recommend if you're using this as a cooling rack.\", 'Title: Do not recommend; Content: Used in oven at 400 degrees making spinach pies, within 3 mins the pan twisted from the heat. Hopefully it will work better for other uses, maybe as a cooling rack for cookies.', 'Title: Warp a lot in the oven; Content: In the oven at 375, these warped a LOT, in fact they clearly wobble even just by hand. Barely thicker than a single use aluminum casserole.', 'Title: Very thin metal; Content: These are very thin. They have already warped & no longer sit flat.', \"Title: Warped first time in the oven; Content: These pans warp under moderate heat (350F and above) which is really a shame because they look really nice. The pans have a shiny finish. I'm going to have to return the whole set, which is a shame, because the racks are nice and work well.\", 'Title: Came with 2 different rack sizes???; Content: Needed sheet pans and racks that would fit inside the toaster oven. Was expecting to have two matching sets of racks and pans. One rack is about an inch smaller on both sides. Cannot comment on warping. Will update when confirmed.', 'Title: Warped and rust stains in one week; Content: I bought these thinking they would not stain or warp in the over but only using them twice, they have done both of those things.', 'Title: No rack!; Content: NO RACK!! Only baking pan what the hell?', \"Title: They warp diagonally - no matter what is on the pan; Content: It warps in the oven, it doesn't matter what you've got on the pan. I don't like aluminum but I'm going to stick with it and use baking sheets!\", 'Title: Warps when in the oven; Content: Apparently pure stainless steel can warp in the oven under heat. It needs aluminum which most commercial grade products have. I put it in a 430 degree Fahrenheit oven with chicken on top of the rack and when I took it out the baking sheet was warped. It does flatten out after a few minutes back to its original shape but why would you want a baking sheet that twists in the heat of an oven?', \"Title: Meh; Content: Half sheet pans don't fit into our small wall oven since we replaced it :-( So we had to order new ones. Our regular, tried and true brand doesn't make this smaller size so we tried these. They warp while in the oven. When cool they revert to mostly flat once again. They don't feel nearly as substantial as our old ones which is probably why they warp. Yes, we can cook on them but we don't love them.\", 'Title: 13\" X 18\" False advertisement!; Content: I ordered the 13 inch by 18 inch pans. I just got them today and measured them, they\\'re ACTUALLY 12 & 1/4 inches by 17 & 5/16 inches. That\\'s almost 1 inch smaller on one side and over half 1 inch smaller on the other side. Very disappointed in the size, if you bake a lot then you know this makes a difference. I still gave them credit for sturdiness and high quality appearance. I haven\\'t used them so I can\\'t comment on durability, ease of cleaning, or sturdiness. We\\'ll see.', 'Title: Warps During Baking, Otherwise Fine; Content: I bought these for cookies, biscuits and bacon. Chocolate chip cookies and drop biscuits release well without non-stick sprays. The sheets clean up easily with hand washing and still look great after nearly a year of frequent use. My only complaint is that they warp at 350-375 °F and more so at 400-425 °F.', 'Title: NOT 12\" x 10\"!!!!; Content: They are almost 12 and 3/8 inches long, they will NOT fit in a 12\" oven. Not 10 inches wide either closer to 9 and a half. 3 stars just \\'cause they look OK.', 'Title: Warps when heated, makes banging noise; Content: Pans \"warp\" when used in 350 degree oven.

When purchased I thought it was a thicker gauge of steel than it is. Wire Racks seem sturdy and well made though.', 'Title: Hard to clean the tray.; Content: The rack is ok to clean, but the tray is very hard to clean and stains easily.', 'Title: warps in oven; Content: The baking sheets work OK, will clean off relatively easy. But the do warp when in oven over 400F. They come back to original shape once cool.', 'Title: Ok baking sheets; Content: They are thinner than I expected', 'Title: Perfect size but needs to be sturdier.; Content: We bought these because they fit perfectly in the new Hamilton Beach toaster oven we bought. The racks were also great to use for cooling baked goods or setting fried foods to keep them from sitting in a puddle of oil. The pan that came with the toaster oven was a very thin aluminum and would buckle when baking. This pan was sturdier but still buckled. :(.', 'Title: Warps when baking cookies for 15 mins; Content: I bought these pans as recommended from Facebook for Anova Oven as they won’t warp while in use. I used the baking sheet for the first time and it bent/warped at the start of baking my cookies.', \"Title: Great for wings!; Content: Great for baking wings! They slightly overlap when using 2 of these sheets at a time; just a little, but i still like them. I baked at 400°F and broiled for about 2.5 min on low on toppest rack and they did not warp or anything. I used parchment paper as a lining under grid rack. The only negetive things that I could think of for these is that for some reason, there are these slightly brownish spots that won't come out when cleaning. Even after scrubbing with a sponge gently with baking soda and soap(minus 1 star for that). I've mostly used enamel baking sheets in past so this is new to me, not sure why this happened...too high temperature..? Also, I think the bottom of the sheet got scratched a little from the metal to metal contact when I was pulling it out of the oven... I'll still keep them though as it took me a lot of time and effort to find these specific kind that are NOT nonstick and NOT aluminum. Great size too if you have a family.\", \"Title: They Work Well; Content: These work well as baking sheets, but I find them slightly annoying as one side will pop up, not allowing the sheet to truly lie flat. I am not sure what is causing this, as I've never experienced it with my other baking sheets, but it's possible the material is much thinner than what I've had in the past. Not a dealbreaker, but I find myself knocking into the lifted side when I am adding food.\", \"Title: Be aware; Content: There's some discoloration due to use & slight warping due high heat baking. Also cooking time seems 15 to 20 minutes longer using stainless steel vrs non-stick baking sheets.\", 'Title: Nice pans.

But atill great pans.', 'Title: Great set for the price; Content: I bought this to cook bacon in the oven and to use to roast vegetables in the oven. Not as thick as an old Revere Ware that I have that I can’t find anywhere now, but it should work for my needs.', 'Title: Size perfect; Content: The size of pans are perfect for baking cookies. Easy to clean. Not flimsy but wish they were a bit heavier. I would recommend these pans.', 'Title: Great Set for Beginner Bakers!; Content: Bought this due to all the quarantine baking goodies I see on IG. These were sturdy and easy to clean. I love how it has the racks with the pans for chocolate drizzling! Going to try bake bacons with them soon!', 'Title: Okay; Content: I use it all the time to bake chix wings and sides fold when it gets too hot.', 'Title: Good quality; Content: Nice pans, good quality, thought the grates would be a heavy gauge but they work well overall. Liked the grid pattern so less food falls through that traditional racks.', 'Title: Great product sturdy; Content: I bought these because my husband was looking for a deeper pan to put in his smoker. These fit right in it and worked great. Love the racks that came with to put the meat on and drippings go into pans. I would recommend them.', 'Title: Good sheet trays, warp at higher temperatures; Content: Sheets and racks are just as described and perform well, but do warp in a medium hot oven (roughly at 200C). They regain their original shape but it can limit baking uses.', 'Title: Decent; Content: Good I guess. I’ve noticed I had to cook my food for longer with these pans versus my old ones but still good.', 'Title: Mirror Finish; Content: 4.5 star. What I like: Top 9.5 ×12.25 bottom 8.75 ×11.5. About almost an inch deep. Fit my new smart airfryer Cosori oven CS100 and CS130-A0 (CS100Oven fits 12\" pizza, narrowest interior width 12.75) Works as carrying tray: sixteen 4 oz yogurt jars (64 oz total) I put it in an preheat toaster oven on airfry function at 400°F for 20 min and turn 180° in between. It didn\\'t wrap, because the fat dripping from bacon distribute the heat evenly. I saw people with twisting pan because there is a small piece of food, cold I assume, in the middle of the pan, I wonder if the entire pan is filled with food and/or if the sheet is placed in the middle position, not too close to the heating elements, would that help with the issue? Or may be switch to black cast iron, it won\\'t ever twisted haha. I haven\\'t tried broil or toast dry stuff yet, will update later with cookies or roast duck. I soaked it in soapy water for a day or two, and sticky, dry bake stuff came right off. Unlike my nonstick, they haven\\'t rusted either. Affordable 4 piece at $20.70, so $5 each. What I don\\'t like: It\\'s beautiful mirror finish but also easily scratched, no matter how gentle and careful you use and clean. I prefer brush finish. Updated: It will warp a little bit when BROILING (not warp on air fry or bake but will on broil function) meat on rack in the pan, due to not enough meat drippings to distribute heat unevenly. To fix this, I fill the pan with just enough water to cover the bottom, then grill the meat on rack, but then meat will be more like steamed broiled. I wonder if corrugated design would be any better?', \"Title: Great deal; Content: For $25 these are way better quality than I expected. Nice and thick, they are flat and they don't warp in the oven. or at least they haven't yet. Mirror stainless finish is nice it does help make it non stick. The grids are kind of a pain to clean but they support food a lot better than the ones that just have the bars lengthwise so thats a trade off you have to consider. If I were just using them for meat I would probably go with the bars for the easier cleanup but if you want something more all purpose these are the ones to get.\", 'Title: Perfect Quality; Content: These are beautiful, sturdy, and excellent quality. On the first night I made veggie quesadillas on them and they came out really nice, cooked on both sides and crispy. They were easy to clean however I will say I gave it a very light coat of EVOO before I put the tortillas on it. The pans are shiny and they cooked very evenly. I am thrilled with the purchase! Especially good to note is how well they were packaged! Wow, wish everything came packaged so well. They have bubble around the set and then each one is on its plastic pillow as well.', \"Title: Quality product; Content: My wife enjoys baking and I'll occasionally use a baking sheet too, so we decided we'd had enough of our el-cheapo Wally World sheets and got these. They're nicely sturdy and kinda heavy, attesting to a not-too-thin steel sheet. The bonus is a pair of cooling racks. They are indeed a mirror-like finish, not the dull finish expected. This makes for easy clean-up. They haven't warped in the oven, although they haven't been subjected to more than 375° F. It's too soon to know if the cooling racks are actually stainless steel instead of chromed steel wire, but I like that they're a grid pattern instead of just straight wires. We like these so much that another pair is to arrive very soon. At a total of 4 of these, my wife will be pleased when she's baking, and we will have enough to rotate full & empty in and out of the oven.\", \"Title: Time Will Tell; Content: They aren't heavyweight or flimsy. I think the mirror finish will probably scratch easily. I've only used them once and nothing was burned or stuck. They are definitely worth the price. Update: I see a lot of reviews about warping in the oven and I've NEVER experienced that. I've only baked at 350F for cookies, frozen garlic bread and pizza. Perhaps try reducing the temp? The mirror finish is still holding up and cleanup is easy. For those who have issues cleaning these. Just use parchment paper or soak them a bit. I use vinegar and dish detergent on all my SS cookware. Oh, I love the racks for cookies, cakes, and fried foods!\", 'Title: Great for cooking bacon in the oven.; Content: We bought these trays to cook bacon in the oven and tried them out this morning. Worked great . . . the bacon grease dripped down into the pan and away from the slices of bacon.', \"Title: Small oven, works perfect; Content: I have a really small oven, I can't fit normal sized baking sheets in them and that makes me sad. I've had these for a few months now and I'm buying another set, not because something is wrong with them, but because they're perfect. I have seen them warp slightly (not enough to spill fat out) in the oven but they usually correct themselves after being out of the oven. I've never cooked directly on them, I always use the racks, so that might be a contributing factor. They clean up really nice too, they don't scratch to the steel wool I use (chore boy) and they're still mirror polished after all this time.\", \"Title: My Go-to baking sheets use them the all the time; Content: These are wonderful baking sheets. I use them for making Bacon, cookies, and just about anything you need a baking sheet for. I use them at 425 degrees at 25 minutes for cooking bacon, and they work great to collect the oil dripping into the pan. During cooking, the sheet will expand like most do but is not a problem very minimal. I'm not concerned with the mirror finish so I clean in my dishwasher.\", \"Title: Rust Free. Heavy; Content: I've had these pans for about a year and just purchased more. They really are rust free. The pans do bend shape when they get really hot, but they flatten perfectly when they cool.\", \"Title: Perfect Cookware Addition; Content: These baking sheets are perfect for our needs. We've used them for oven roasting, baking and broiling. We line the bottom with foil for an even easier cleanup, yet a few minutes in a hot water soak makes it just as easy if we hadn't used foil. As always the mesh rack takes some effort to clean, but after a soak, some vigorous brushing and a session in the dishwasher, it looks like new.\", 'Title: Fabulous pans; Content: I like these pans. I’ve made chicken wings that came out real krispie. Hamburgers and steaks. The fat drips down to the bottom pan so you’re not getting any extra fat. I cover the bottom pan with foil, and I spray the top rack with pam. That way nothing sticks to the rack which makes it easy to clean.', 'Title: Great for Our Convection Oven; Content: We live full time in our Class A RV, so our oven is tiny and our convection oven is also pretty small.

We do use silicone pads to keep things from sticking to the pans and make cleanup easier.', \"Title: Beautiful, heavy, highest quality set at an incredible price!; Content: This is a beautiful, heavy, highest quality set of two baking sheets with two racks. They are stainless steel with a beautiful mirror finish that makes them so easy to clean. If they're always cleaned with a Dobie plastic mesh scrubber or a brush, they won't scratch and will remain easy to clean. I also have enjoyed the racks to roast cut up veggies, potatoes or anything else over the pans. The quality of these is hard to believe at this price. Highly recommend!\", \"Title: Great quality, very useful; Content: Exactly what I wanted. My years of making tin foil 'racks' are over. Rack is well made, not flimsy, as is pan. Much nicer than what came with toaster oven. Gave the second one to my mom and she is happy with it too.\", 'Title: Heavy weight pan; Content: This is a well made baking sheet and rack. Made of stainless steel, has a great professional weight and a good overall size. Beautifully made.

Easy clean up, big. Great for draining oil from food.', 'Title: Great baking sheets & racks!!!; Content: Love the stainless steel, the quality of the racks, & and, is outstanding. I baked some bacon, scraped the grease into the trash, washed pans & racks in the dishwasher, came out as clean as new', 'Title: love, love...; Content: Large but not overly so and very sturdy. Love these pans. They are solid but not heavy. The 2 largest in the set are my favorite. Perfect with the covers. Just what I was looking for. See the pictures of the pan I had for over 15 years (which I have used a lot!) next to the largest of the new set. These are perfect to season and marinate large amounts of meats. Just an advice for those complaining about the covers not fitting DO NOT WASH IN DISHWASHER! This is clearly stated online as well as in the package. The pans can be placed in the dishwasher but NOT the covers. To close, just line up cover on top of pan and press on the center of the cover. To open pull up on the sides. Easy. Did I say i love these?... ☺', \"Title: Black coating chips after first couple of uses; Content: Items are sturdy and very shape which was nice.

Not very happen with this product.\", 'Title: Not stainless steal!; Content: These are not stainless steel! Do not buy if you are looking for a healthy cooking surface! Magnets stick right to them proving they are not stainless', 'Title: Cheaply made; Content: These look very shiny. But not all that glitters is gold. I put one of these in the oven on a typical baking temperature, and within a couple of minutes I heard a loud pop. I looked in the oven, and the sheet had badly warped. There’s a reason these are so cheap. They are very cheaply made, with thin steel that you can easily bend with your hands. They’re useless for baking. I don’t know why this site allows this no-name garbage to be sold. I’m returning mine.', 'Title: Welded the first 2min in Oven; Content: I got my two baking sheets today and used them right away. And the first 2 min in the oven at 375 F it welded. I really was hopeful but really disappointment. Would not recommend it at all', 'Title: Will bend while baking.; Content: It bent while it was in the oven at 325. First time use.

Immediately buckled in the oven. Junk!', 'Title: The Pan warped the first time I used it at only 425°; Content: I just missed the return window and I’m so disappointed.

Mine will be used for sorting or serving trays.', 'Title: Bends in the oven, Hard to Clean!; Content: I wish I never bought it. First, I got a returned tray. The box was bent and it was obvious a consumer had returned it and it was somehow shipped to me. I didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning so kept it. I wish I did though. Second and most important, the trays are not the quality I was expecting. They bend in the oven (and freezer), and they are hard to clean. I use baking sheets but sometimes some residue falls on the tray and I haven’t been able to scrape that off. So disappointing because I paid extra expecting better quality.', 'Title: Pans go POP and warp EVERY time I use them at 400 degrees! In contact w/ seller for refund!; Content: These pans make a POP sound and warp EVERY time I use them at 400 degrees! Once cooled, they go back to their regular shape.

But they may not be 100% Stainless. They are spotting. I typically use parchment for cooking or baking. Nothing major actually cooks ON the pan. Spots won’t scrub off? I missed my return window by just a few days. I regret lot buying different ones.', \"Title: Warp at high temps. Not worth the money.; Content: These looks great and work well, except that they warp at any temp over 350F. They go back to normal when they cool, but it's still frustrating and make the food cook unevenly on top.\", 'Title: Not as good as I hoped; Content: I was very impressed with the looks of the pans and how tall the rims were, but during their first use in the oven they immediately warped. I was roasting some veggies at 425 so maybe the high heat was too much for them. I will see what happens at 350, but I am thinking I will just have to get used to warping pans.

Price not bad. Economical value', 'Title: Good, but too big to fit in my dishwasher.; Content: I wanted some stainless steel baking sheets because I believe they are the healthier choice. I was hesitant to purchase them because I have read reviews about stainless steel baking sheets warping or popping in the oven.I did expect them to warp some, but hoping they will not pop and splatter drippings in the oven. I was happy to find that these sheets did not pop with heat 350° to 425°. They did warp but went back to the original shape once cooled. They look pretty nice with a mirror like finish. A problem I have with them is that they are a little too big to fit in my basic dishwasher, which I should have factored in.', 'Title: Great value, non-toxic pan; Content: For the price I’d say these pans are pretty great, they are large, relatively sturdy, and the high sides are a great feature. I’d like to mention one reviewer claimed these are not stainless steel because they are magnetic, but there are actually several different kinds of stainless steel, some are magnetic, some not. I believe these are stainless steel as marketed (though maybe a lower grade?) and therefore a suitable cooking surface for the health conscious buyer.', \"Title: Pleasantly surprised; Content: I did a lot of research before I bought these pans. I wanted to replace my old non-stick (possibly Teflon) coated pans. From what I understand, non-stick coatings are mostly toxic in one way or another. I decided on these stainless steel pans after reading other reviews. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised. I've had them a few months now and they still look new. They cook evenly and food does not stick when using a little oil. Very durable and seem high quality. I would buy again.\", 'Title: These are the best sheets!; Content: We LOVE these sheets! We use them for roasting vegetables and for dinners 4-5 times a week. They are very sturdy. I believe I’ll be able to hand them down to my children, their children and their children! Nice even heat makes everything bake/roast so evenly.', \"Title: Perfect for me... 2 stainless steel baking pans; Content: I've been using a large thin super shallow aluminum baking pan for 40 plus years. These stainless baking pans are taking its place. Much easier to roast my nuts in one of these than that other pan, with which I had to take care not to spill nuts. Baking is better too, I don't find that one end of the pan browns faster, a weakness of that aluminum pan. Beautiful too. I'm totally satisfied.\", \"Title: Good size and thick; Content: These are a good size. Fits my standard size oven very well. They are thick and sturdy. They don't twist like my old sheets. I like that they are steel, not aluminimum. I've known too many people who used aluminimum cookware and had early dementia. So, avoiding aluminimum in the kitchen is important to me.\", \"Title: Baking to your heart's content; Content: These are awesome and huge and they are well built they are heavy so I know that they are going to last you can bake a lot of cookies at once on them\", 'Title: Remarkable quality; Content: I love these trays. They are full sized and they fit inside my wall oven perfectly. I have washed these trays many times in a standard-size dishwasher, absolutely no sign of rust. No staining either. When I compare these cooking trays to every other tray I own, there is no comparison. I bought these because I wanted to reduce my exposure to aluminum trays.', 'Title: Easy to clean; Content: They tend to warp in the oven temporarily, but regain shape when cool. Much easier to clean than our old aluminum sheets.', 'Title: Make easy carrying food from Grill to table.; Content: I purchased these Trays to use while Barbecuing in my yard. Finally I used them today , and I tell you that it makes it much easier to carry all the cooked food on to the table. They’re sturdy and easy to clean stainless steel.', \"Title: Decent Stainless Baking Sheets; Content: So far, so good. Baked good don't burn like they do using coated (dark) sheets. I use paper, so cleaning is not an issue. Haven't used them about 350F so no warping issues.\", 'Title: Numbers fade and not legible!; Content: I have had these for about 5 months and cook frequently. They look great but the paint with the numbers fade quickly to the point where they arent legible. Do not recommend because they are useless without the numbers on them.', 'Title: Yes easily warp ! ! !; Content: The description says \"no easily warp in the oven\" (that\\'s their English, not mine). It warped on the very 1st use. It was not in the oven two minutes when you could hear bounce up. The warp was verified upon opening the oven. One corner was up over an inch while the other three remained in touch with the oven rack.', \"Title: This warped the first time I used it; Content: I saw reviews saying they warped, but didn't credit them too much since there were so many good reviews. Unfortunately, one in the set of two warped the first time I used it and the finish came off both of them when they were washed. Do not recommend it.\", 'Title: Ruined on first use; Content: There were no directions for how to use these pans and liners. Used them one time baked potatoes at 475 degrees. Some of the silicone adhered to the bottom of the pan. That means some of the silicone adhered to our food! I did not find the liner easy to wipe clean. It took some scrubbing and left stains even though baked pototoes are not particulary messy.

I made pumpkin scones today on this sheet, the first time out and 5 minutes in I heard the desperate bang of a warped sheet pan. So dissatisfied and disappointed. What the ???', 'Title: Mold grew on them...; Content: I had to throw both stones out after one use. I washed them according to directions. The stains from the pizza never came out. You can’t use soap on the stones. I put them away after they dried. Months later, I went to get them out of a cabinet to make pizzas and they had purple/black mold growing on them where the first pizza made some stains. I have never had mold problems in my home. I do not recommend.', 'Title: Not as described; Content: I haven’t had these pans long and only used them a couple of times. Oil will stain the pans if used in the oven, the silicone mats are too big for the pans, and after only a couple uses the pans are warped. The silicone mats are hard to clean and the pans are flimsy. Wouldn’t recommend at all.', 'Title: Cheaply made; Content: Sheet tray material is paper thin, this is not a quality product. You get what you pay for. Mats are fine.', 'Title: They Warp ALOT 3\"; Content: These pans are trash. They warped almost 3 inches on one side the first time we put them in the oven. If you want a cooking sheet that lays flat, these are not them.', \"Title: Don't buy; Content: Pans are terrible cheap made\", 'Title: Don’t order this.; Content: The mats crinkled in the oven... unusable', 'Title: Awful pan; Content: When hot it warps😡😡', 'Title: These suck; Content: These suck, they warp even when I bake at 350. The silicone mats have started to brown. These are low quality save your money.', \"Title: Garbage- burned on first use; Content: I used these to roast broccoli at 425. One corner charred the broccoli and burned the liner and down through to the pan. In addition to the poor quality of the mat, the pans are very thin and flimsy. They may be fine for light baking, but they don't hold up to roasting.\", 'Title: Mats too big for pans; Content: The interior dimensions of this pan are 15\"x11\" and the silicone mat\\'s length is closer to 11.5\" making it too long to lie flat in the pan. Frustrating since getting a mat that would perfectly fit the pan was why I bought this product. Returning.', \"Title: Looks like a high-quality item, handles like a low-quality item.; Content: These unusually, unbranded sheets come in an almost unnaturally mirror-polished finish which, while it looks very nice, is just really susceptible to blemishes. The sheets arrived in plastic wrap with streaks across the surface. When putting the sheets into the oven, they grate obnoxiously against the oven racks, and I could just feel the 'shiny mirror finish' scratching awfully. More importantly though, they warped. Awfully. Within 15 minutes of roasting an honestly very small amount of vegetables, the very first time, they twisted significantly across the middle. They relax again once taken out of the oven, but I know from experience with my previous baking sheets... the next time I put it in the oven, it's going to violently twist back into its warped shape with a loud TWANG, and send food flying all over my oven.\", 'Title: Product wrapt badly and does not conduct heat to food property.; Content: I was excited for these baking trays to arrive. They warped the one only time I used them (only at 350º F.) Is also took double time (instead pf 40 minutes it was one hour and 20 minutes for my hasbrowms to brown just a little on the bottom, so I end up using the broiler to at least brown the top. Disappointed!!!', 'Title: Warps badly in oven; Content: I really wanted to leave a great review on these. I love the silicone mats, they are fantastic. The pans are very nice, but on the very first use they made a loud pop and warped badly in the oven, that was very disappointing.', 'Title: Warped at 375°. BIG mess!; Content: First use it warped at 375°. Flung pizza all over the place. Not sturdy enough for higher heat cooking. Silpat is nice. Hence 2 starts not one.', 'Title: Edging flakes off; Content: Loved the silicone mats until the edging started to flake off after only 2 months. The baking sheets aluminum sheets seem to be well made and very sturdy.', 'Title: One out of two worth buying.; Content: Honestly disappointing pans. I went for stainless steel because I bake at high temps and I don’t want a pan that warps. It does. The liners are great! I recommend them.', 'Title: Macaron Bakers, Beware; Content: The pans warped after the first use and the mats work for non stick but not for measuring out the size of macaron shells. I’m not even sure what the purpose of the tiny circles is. Wish I could return.', 'Title: Do not purchase; Content: These sheets bow easily when in the oven. Very disappointed. I would definitely not purchase again.', 'Title: Very thin material; Content: Pans warp in the oven at normal baking temps', 'Title: Despite what is mentioned in the product features, they DO warp in the oven.; Content: Put them into an oven at 350 and they noticeably warped, heard a sharp pop, when they did.', 'Title: Metal bends; Content: I love the silicone mats, but the metal pans bend when exposed to heat.', 'Title: Yes, they warp (at first); Content: UPDATE: after using them a few times, they have stopped warping. It seems they needed a few times in a hot oven to — what, temper — and now they are the heavy baking sheets I wanted. The baking sheets are nice and heavy — imagine my surprise when they warped in the oven. I am so disappointed. I am making do because I don’t often bake foods that would be ruined by a warping pan, but the sound of the pan warping in the oven is such an irritation that I’m sure I will replace these pans soon.', \"Title: Yes, they warp in the oven. Not good for sheet cake.; Content: I specifically bought these for a non-warp pan and am greatly disappointed that they do indeed warp in the oven. Granted, not as bad as my old pans but they still do. Liner doesn't quite fit on pan but not too bad. But once something is baked onto this pan, it takes a whole lot of scrubbing to get it off but that seems par for the course with stainless steel regardless. The silicone mat performs similar to others I've had so not many complaints there other than the size not being quite right.\", 'Title: This baking sheet DOES warp,,,; Content: We tested these pans in our Breville BOV900BSS Smart Oven Air Convection and Air Fry Countertop Oven when we got them. I was very pleased with how well they fit on the oven rack, it was like sheet pans were made for this oven. We heated each pan to 425 and they did not warp; very pleased. Today we roasted carrots in the toaster oven using the sheet pan and one of the silicon mats and POP, the pan warped less than halfway through the roasting. Very disappointing as we like everything else about these baking sheet pans. 20201025 Tried one of these pans without the mat today to roast potato wedges. One corner lifted 3 to 4 inches so we are sending the pans and mats back and will try a different brand. Really too bad as we liked everything else about these baking sheets.', 'Title: Unusual size is just what I wanted.; Content: In my manufactured home, oven size is smaller than most ovens therefore the size of my roaster and baking sheets should be slightly smaller. These sheets are the perfect size. Two complaints: 1) I bought 2 pans which came with SilPat pads. I also wanted the wire racks that fit this size pan but to do that I had to buy to more pans which I do not want, and; 2) the weight and thickness was considerable smaller than the half-size pans and warped when used in the oven but did return to flat when cooled. They are usable but I will not buy again.', \"Title: dissapointed; Content: I like the silicone mats and that they are ,for now, easy to clean. For the price I was hoping for heavier sturdy pans. I wouldn't recommend these if a sturdy stainless steel pan is what you are looking for. These are very light weight and shiny suggesting they may not be as described but aluminum. And the ones I received did warp at 400 degrees for 15minutes in the oven.A bit disappointing.\", 'Title: Warp City, USA; Content: These pans just arrived in the mail. I cleaned them and baked a couple of cookies on them. The oven was only heated up to 325° and it started to warp. Pretty sad. The silicone mats worked well for removing the cookies. I would warn that these trays would not be good if you are making a water bath for ramekins for flan, crème brûlée, or anything that would require the pan to stay flat during the baking process.', \"Title: Too thin - they pop and go off balance very easily; Content: They fit in my Cuisinart Air fryer toaster oven so that's why I'm giving them three stars. And I appreciate the non stick tray mats they included. Unfortunately they are not sturdy at all when they are in the oven. They are very thin and they pop and go off balance even on very low temperatures. I use them mostly as utility trays because they aren't reliable when placed in the oven.\", \"Title: Not food grade silicone- something with chemicals; Content: The pans seem fine. I haven't used them yet. I made the purchase for the pans and was skeptical of the silicone mats because they're manufactured in China. I suspected they wouldn't be food grade silicone, and I would wager that I was right on that one. Real food grade silicone doesn't have an odor, but these definitely have a sweet, chemical odor to them. If I were you I'd toss these mats and get a Silpat to be safe. These are either a high-temp plastic or a silicone resin with contaminants.\", 'Title: These warp in the oven; Content: These warp in the oven when they get hot. We have them used them for ~2 weeks now and they do it every time we use them without the silicone mats. Definitely not very sturdy. However, they are easy to clean, the mats work great, and they seem relatively durable despite the warping.', 'Title: These \"warp\" in oven; Content: I was hoping these wouldn\\'t \"warp\" in the oven - reviews on this were 50/50. Sadly, they warp/twist in the oven. So they are okay for cookies but not any kind of batter - was hoping to use these for jelly roll. Glad I tried them with cookies first.', \"Title: Could be better; Content: They twist while in the stove and pop back after you take them out. I thought the quality would be better. I've bought larger and cheaper pans with better quality.\", 'Title: Warps with every use.; Content: I wanted to love these pans as they are highly loved in my Breville Oven groups. The size is prefect and I love the mats but these pans warp which really causes a problem baking. It warped with the very first use, while it didn’t stay that way it’s still frustrating. Everytime it goes in the oven it warps and causes uneven baking.', 'Title: Durability an issue; Content: Nice size for my counter top oven. I have only used the pans 3 times and the finish is already coming off in spots. Very disappointing in that respect.', 'Title: They will work; Content: The silicone mats are fantastic, easy to use, easy to clean. The pans themselves bend and flex and after 1 use no longer lay flat.', \"Title: Warps in oven; Content: I wanted to like this product but every time I use it to bake something, when I take it out of the oven it is warped. When it cools it goes flat again. So far it hasn't affected anything I have baked but for the price I paid I expect better.\", 'Title: Ok; Content: The pans are not as sturdy as I would have liked. They tend to warp when hot.', 'Title: Nice looking but not sturdy; Content: The pans are not heavy duty at all. They twist when they heat up in the oven, which make them unsafe to use if you are cooking something like candied bacon.', 'Title: Cheaply made pans; Content: They seem to be very cheaply made, warped in the oven the first time I used them.', \"Title: Pans warp in the oven; Content: Silicon sheets are fine but the pans warp as soon as they heat up. I've bought better pan at Walmart. Do not recommend and I definitely wasted my money.\", 'Title: Not that great; Content: I thought these would be sturdier. When roasting they bend and lift', 'Title: Nice cooking sheets, but warps when hot; Content: My sheets warp when they get hot - large popping noise. This hasn\\'t affected most items that I\\'ve baked so far (biscuits and such), but when I recently roasted some sunflower seeds, the sheets warped when hot - and it gives a large bang/pop when it does so --- a few of the seeds popped right out of the tray and onto the oven floor. Now I get to clean my oven so that my house doesn\\'t fill with smoke from the few burning seeds on the bottom of my oven. (I know you don\\'t care, but I JUST cleaned my oven 2-3 weeks ago, so I\\'m annoyed.) When I say warped, I mean the two opposite corners go up between 1/2\" to 3/4\". When they cool back down, they return back to flat shape. With that said, they\\'ll work for most purposes, but disappointed about the warping. I\\'ll continue to use them, but will no longer use them for roasting nuts or seeds.', \"Title: The mats baked well; Content: the mats definitely cooked well and my bread didn't stick. The pan is flimsy and warped in the oven but went flat once cooled. It didn't effect my bread cooking but scared me when it popped and the corner rose in the heat. The pans are thin but served their purpose and I love the silicone mats\", 'Title: Easier to clean than regular pans; Content: I never before tried a washable rubber or silicon baking sheet liner and I like it. It makes baking and cleaning up a lot easier. It spares the pan underneath the liner from getting so dirty so fast like my past baking sheets that didn’t have liners. I would use parchment paper on the pans before but despite the parchment the pan itself would get such a burnt finish. I’m hoping the rubber or silicon liner keeps the pan shiny longer.', 'Title: Amazing quality for the price.; Content: Solid 4. My step mom has some of these but hers were WAY more expensive and these work just as good. The mats come clean easily/nothing sticks to them. And because of them the pan stays so clean. There was no drippings at all on them after cooking bacon wrapped jalapeños. Probably going to buy more for my sweet niece and my sister and everyone else I know because everyone that cooks should have a set.', 'Title: Overall a good buy, do slightly warp though; Content: Overall a good buy, I would recommend. I use this mostly for baking cookies and the mats are a lifesaver and make clean up easy! The only downside is that the pans do warp slightly while in the oven, it’s nothing major and they always return to normal after being pulled out of the oven but they definitely do become a little off kilter during a baking session. It has never affected the quality of my baked goods though.', 'Title: Good pans; Content: The pans aren’t the best of quality but still great for the price and perfect for cookies. The silicone mat is a plus! The template printed on them isn’t big enough for my intended macrons but perfect for royal icing transfers. Happy with my purchase!', \"Title: They get the job done; Content: I've never used slipmats before so using them is a really nice change from parchment paper. I haven't tried temperatures above 400 F with the slip mat so I can't say much towards the high-temperature durability. However, I will say the metal pans aren't the best quality. They look nice, but you can hear them warp in the oven even at 375 F. Good to get the job done, but not great.\", \"Title: Very nonstick; Content: I bought this as an alternative to typical nonstick pans. It's a bit hard to tell if you have completely cleaned the silicon mat, especially after cooking greasy foods. But in this case, I feel the benefits outweigh this minor issue. It's extremely nonstick (even if grease seeps below the mat), and works with many foods.\", 'Title: Went bang and bent while hot. Flat while room temp.; Content: Shiny mirror polish when arrives does scratch a bit when using abrasive. Mats fit snuggly. Only thing concerning was once in the oven one of the pans went bang and one corner bent up. But once it cooled back it was flat again. Unfortunately the two pans do not fit side by side in my oven.', 'Title: These are great!; Content: I really like these for using in my RV combo convection/microwave oven. They are a perfect size. Clean easily and are very sturdy.', 'Title: Silicone mats do what they are suppose to do; Content: Love my mats, and love that they fit perfectly on the baking sheets. I just wish the baking sheets didn’t buckle after the first bake. I hate when they warp and get distorted when they are hot.', 'Title: Silicone mats rule!; Content: These are great but they warp a little bit in the oven when the temps get hot. They still do the trick though and I’ve had no issues. The silicone mats are my favorite and can’t imagine life without them now.', 'Title: Warp at temperature; Content: Nice finish, nice silpat, but the pans will warp in the oven, despite the decent rolled edges.', 'Title: Too big for my countertop oven; Content: Slightly too long. I thought I’d found the perfect pan, but it just doesn’t fit.', 'Title: The Silicone Mats Make this Product; Content: We have, and have had, lots of cookies sheets over the years. The cookies sheets range from steel pans that needed a non-stick spray, to expensive, heavy cookies sheets with ceramic coatings. These cookies sheets are unusual because they pair non-stick silicone sheets with relatively light stainless steel cookie sheets. The silicone sheets really make this product. The stainless steel is not non-stick, and anything that touches the stainless will likely stick to the stainless and require quite a bit of scrubbing to remove. The silicone sheets, on the other hand, are thick and look great. Without the silicone sheets, these cookie sheets seem to us to be relatively cheap cookies sheets. It is the silicone sheets that really bring the value to these cookie sheets. As for value, our rating is average based mostly on the addition of the silicone sheets. Without the sheets, this product would be below average. Our overall rating is four stars, influenced by the cheap cookie sheets paired with great non-stick silicone sheets. The silicone sheets are fast and easy to clean, ready to go within seconds after cookies, biscuits, or whatever are removed from the sheets. Indeed, the sheets may outlast the stainless steel. We can only hope! Enjoy!', \"Title: Great Set! Baking times need watching; Content: We unboxed these and put them to work right away as we have been feeding thanksgiving family guests this weekend. I was super excited and after washing off the silpats and trays we set to baking meringues and cookies. I was a little amazed at how much shipping material was used to package this. Each tray and silpat was lined in plastic...it felt wasteful. No sticking issues with either of our baked products; but one caveat and I dropped a star for this...we had to add a few minutes to each recipe because the pans are thicker than our usual baking set. I think the gauge is thicker, so just be sure to watch carefully and don't rely exclusively on recommended bake times in your recipe book. Maybe this could be offset by convection.\", 'Title: Warping? What warping?; Content: When I read the reviews on the sheet pans, I almost did not buy them. I am a chef, and these pans are exactly as described, sturdy, stanless steel, and easy to clean. My first experience was roasting cauliflower, came out great. I roasted at 400 degrees, no warping. Mat wiped off. Next was biscuits in the morning, and they came out beautifully, no sticking, no warping and a cinch to clean. On top of all that, price is really good for the 4 pieces.', 'Title: Heavy, sturdy, quality pans; Content: All of a sudden I realized my baking sheets were OLD non-stick coated and in bad condition. I have no idea why it took me so long to replace them....but I love these and hope to buy two more. They clean beautifully, and the silicon liners wipe clean so easily as well. Highly recommend.', \"Title: Perfect; Content: These baking sheets are heavy duty, someone in a write up said they weren't. I just got rid of some antique baking sheets and I would have to say these are the same weight or slightly heavier. The silicone mats ensure nothing sticks, also durable and easy to clean.\", 'Title: Works like a charm - no more parchment paper; Content: Ordered these to use to make cake balls, cookies, other desserts and even cook sweet potatoes and veggies on it. Works great, I can kiss the parchment paper goodbye and save on waste. Baked - 350 to 425 for 2 months so far; no warping or issues Cleaning - light scrub with soap and dry overnight, but gets all residue off much easier than anticipated', 'Title: Very good weight and size! Great looking set.; Content: I prefer stainless steel products for my kitchen because they are easy to care for and are very durable. I am really happy with these stainless steel baking pans with the silicone baking sheets. The only problem I had was the package had been split open straight down the top and on one end. We were home when it was delivered and opened the door right after it was dropped on the porch. I reported this to our postman and the post office. I am certain it happened somewhere in the post office.', 'Title: excellent product; Content: these are thick silicone with marks/measurements on them. my baked goods come out great and never stick. these are easy to clean and they kinda stick to the pan once placed on it. i just store my 2 baking sheets with these pads on them so i just grab a pan and go.', \"Title: I use these all the time; Content: The pans are sturdy and easy to clean. The silicone mat is also easy to clean. I try to be more environmentally friendly in the kitchen and I love that I'm not using so much parchment paper all the time now. Getting two at this price is a pretty good deal.\", \"Title: Nice pans, but warp in oven.; Content: These looked beautiful taking them out of the packaging. They have stayed nice and clean looking after lots of use. The silicon is super handy and nice to have. My only complaint would be that they aren't very thick causing them to warp in a hot oven.\", 'Title: Charity Trays; Content: These trays were brought to support and raise funds for one of our Special Education programs within our local High School. The Individuals with Disabilities cook Chocolate Chip cookies for the High School students, which both students look forward to enjoying every Friday. The silicone mats are easy to wipe clean. The trays do not hold any grease and can be wiped clean as well. A good investment!', \"Title: Delighted with these!; Content: I searched quite a while, way too long, going back and forth with measurements to try to figure out which mats would fit which pans. Just when I'd decided it wasn't worth more time, I came across these. The pans are large and sturdy; the mats come with them and fit perfectly, My cookies are happy, and I am delighted.\", 'Title: Wonderful purchase! Absolutely perfect for baking!; Content: What a wonderful purchase!!! Highly highly recommend!!! I love these mats for baking! The cookies are so easy to get off the tray. I made another batch with foil and used non-stock spray and it did nothing. I could barely get the cookies off the tray without having them fall apart. Excellent purchase!', 'Title: Highly recommend; Content: I have been baking on these just about daily since I got them weeks ago. They clean up easily. I do wash them by hand and towel dry immediately. The mats clean up nice and nothing has stuck to them.', \"Title: Great set of pans; Content: We really like these pans! They're not too hard to clean (we hand wash the pans and put the silicone inserts in the dishwasher). We've used them for all sorts of stuff and they come out great.\", 'Title: Buy these, excellent value.; Content: Love love love! Made baking fun again! Silicon sheets are a perfect fit pans are sturdy, shiny stainless steel, great value. Nothing sticks, so easy to clean! I made about a thousand cookies and my sheets still look clean with nothing but a quick wipe in between. Buy these.', 'Title: I burn cookies. Pretty much all the time.; Content: This is a HUGE help. It gives you a little extra time to get to the oven. For those of us who want fresh, warm cookies but lose interest once the dough is made.', \"Title: They bake great; Content: I'm not sure what the material is that lines the bottom of the pan, but it works great. I bought these to replace the big box store's non-stick baking pans. These work so much better and I expect they will last a lot longer as the non-stick are starting to rust on the bottom edges.\", 'Title: Best cookie sheets I have ever owned; Content: Excellent product, thought the were kind of expensive but they are well worth the price, very pleased with how well they work, the ease of clean up is fantastic. Recommed', 'Title: Excellent quality, heavy duty; Content: Excellent quality and durability. Mat fits pan perfectly and transfers heat excellently. Have cooked everything from pork chops to cookies and biscuits. Very easy to clean, even if juices run over and bake on. Hot soapy water and a scotch brite pad and it comes off quickly.', 'Title: Warped; Content: One of the four containers came warped so the lid would not latch onto the container. Other than that, I really like the set. With my busy schedule and trying to get my kitchen together, I do not have time to send them back just to replace the one.', 'Title: Warped after first us; Content: Warped after first use in 425 degrees. Will try again with gradially heating and update review.', \"Title: Not for anyone who really bakes; Content: If you're a serious baker, don't waste your time. These are flimsy and they stick to your oven grate or anything metal, making them very difficult to put into or pull out of the oven. You get what you pay for, and in this case, it's a complete waste of money.\", 'Title: One arrived scratched and warped upon use; Content: I really wanted to love these. One arrived with a horizontal scratch across the middle of it even though it was wrapped and had a foam piece between itself and the other pan. I don’t think it was from shipping. I think the makers packaged a scratched product to sell. I was disappointed, but figured they were going to get scratched with use anyway so I kept them. Today, I put one in the oven for the first time. It was at 425 degrees F. It warped badly within a minute of being in there. Really disappointed in these all together.', \"Title: Warps in the oven. Do not recommend.; Content: These baking pans are garbage. They warp in the oven, preventing you from being able to take the pan out and lay it on a trivet because it's not flat when heated. The one job of a baking pan is to go into the oven flat, and come out flat. This one fails. I posted a picture as proof. That is 30min in a 350 degree oven. Unacceptable.\", 'Title: Bends when hot; Content: These pans warp and bend in the oven. Do not purchase.', \"Title: WILL WARP EVERY TIME!; Content: Don't try these. They cannot even handle 400 degrees without twisting. The fact that they straighten back out after cooking is pointless. Cooking something like skewers makes is almost impossible to remove them from the oven without spilling liquid. These are the single worst pans I have ever used.\", 'Title: USED GOODS; Content: BOTH BAKING SHEETS WERE USED. One was scratched and both were sticky. Some one used these baking sheets and tried to clean them with inferior products then returned them. I cleaned them. No more sticky spots. The scratches remain but I bought them to go under my coffee pots on a stainless steel table and I will use them for that.', \"Title: warped in oven for first use; Content: These warped the first time we put them in the oven. Now they don't sit flat.\", \"Title: Low quality product; Content: They bend when they hit up in the oven which means that whatever you're baking is not cooking evenly. Also oil/grease collects in the far corners because the tray is bend and the middle is elevated. Pretty cheap and crappy quality. Do not recommend.\", 'Title: Sheets bend while in the oven; Content: These cookie sheets sure look beautiful, however while in the oven they bend, therefore things bake unevenly. Once out of the oven and as the sheets cool down they “pop” back into shape. I would not recommend buying these.', 'Title: Warped in Oven. DO NOT BUY; Content: Opened it up and in my first bake, the pans warped in the oven. Do not buy!', 'Title: Buckle up; Content: It would buckle up as it got hot in oven.', 'Title: Warped in the oven!; Content: Warped pretty quickly in the oven. Very unhappy with this product.', 'Title: Left Uncleanable Black Residue After First Use; Content: Very sturdy and good looking pans...but after first use of baking some basic vegetables at 375 degrees, several spots of a black residue were left on the pan. The spots were uncleanable...almost as if it was beneath the surface of the pan. Very disappointing...returned them.', 'Title: Bad Quality - These pans warp in the oven; Content: These are beautiful but they warp in the oven. I’m very disappointed.', 'Title: Warped on first use; Content: Both pans warped the first time they were used (425 degree oven). Totally unacceptable.', 'Title: They warp!; Content: The first time I used them they twisted when they got hot. I can buy cheap baking sheets at a grocery store that are as good.', 'Title: NOT easy to clean, leaves weird residue.; Content: I bought these because of the great reviews and the price. They are beautiful and was so excited to use them. I used them once to make homemade meatballs and it took me FOREVER to clean it and it still was not clean. There was a weird residue left on the pan after trying to wash it, and did not look like it did when I first bought it, after ONE use. Back to shopping again. Had to return.', 'Title: Not easy to clean; Content: Your statement that these are easy to clean does not include the statement \"not easy to clean if you use spray on cooking spray\". The spray has stuck on so bad that even \"Comet\" will not budge the stuck on gluey substance. Any suggestions or does no one actually read these reviews. One of these pans is already ruined.', 'Title: Inferior materials, poor performance; Content: Warped / twisted after the first bake, 400° for ten minutes. These are built to fool people into thinking they’re thick and sturdy professional baking sheets. Don’t waste your time.', \"Title: Stainless??? Not so much; Content: The pans are a good size and appearsl to be good quality, but they are not stainless. It didn't take long to be permanently stained. I actually purchased them, because I wanted a stainless steel pan.\", 'Title: They twist in the heat of the oven; Content: They warp and twist in the oven.', 'Title: Not easy to clean; Content: They’re not easy to clean as stated and olive oil sticks to sheets.', \"Title: They were not what I expected.; Content: I wanted baking sheets that didn't warp in the oven. These said heavy duty so I thought they would work. THEY DID NOT. A WASTE OF MONEY. Judi Botwin\", 'Title: Not heavy duty; Content: These pans are not “heavy duty” as stated', 'Title: Does mirror finish affect baking time.; Content: Warped severely during baking. Returned to original flatness when cooled. No instructions regarding use and maintence.', 'Title: not heavy duty enough; Content: After only a few minutes in the oven at 325 degrees F the pan warped and was no longer level. And the set arrived with a mar/flaw on the shiny mirror surface of one of the pans. Disappointing.', 'Title: larger than advertised; Content: Pans are good quality, but they are 10.65 inches making them too large for the toaster oven.', 'Title: buckle when heated.; Content: The pans when they get hot buckle! Not a good thing!', 'Title: Warped baking sheets.; Content: Both warped after first use in oven.', 'Title: Warps under any heat.; Content: I have to say I’m pretty unhappy with these. They’re far too lightweight, and they warp under even low heat. I had them in the oven at 300°, and they warped and tossed the food off of the pan… Definitely not the desired outcome. Sad to say, I will be returning them. On the flipside they are really easy to clean, and super lightweight!', 'Title: Warps after heating up. Very odd.; Content: The baking sheet popped and warped when I heated it up in my oven to 400 degrees. This caused my food to slide across the baking sheet and some cooking fluids poured onto the bottom of my stove. When it cooled down it popped back to its original form. I tried the baking sheet a second time and it popped again after heating up and warped.', \"Title: Beautiful finish. Warps with the slightest heat.; Content: Beautiful finish. Warps with the slightest heat. Thin. Thin. Thin. I didn't have high hopes for an inexpensive pair, but they warp like crazy in even a 350° over. Skip these.\", 'Title: disappointed; Content: disappointed in these pans. they are flimsy and twist in the oven', \"Title: Does the job but can bend easily; Content: After my first use, it scratched easily and does easily bend after say like 40 mins in the oven at 180'C\", 'Title: Thin thin thin stainless; Content: I hate to give bad reviews but I know that I like honesty in a product so here it goes. The plus side is that it’s stainless instead of aluminum which leaches into our brain over time. The down aide is that it is very hard to clean unless you use the silpat sheets while baking. Ok so....Problem solved by using the sheets. The main concern is what others have already complained about....during the first use the pans warp. Very low grade of thin stainless. I purchased 8 pans for me and other family members at Christmas and they are having the same issue.', 'Title: The pans are okay.; Content: They are made from a heavy weight material. Everything I bake on these pans sticks. I have to really scrub to get the stuck part off of the pan. I have learned to spray them before cooking. I do not like the way the pans buckle up and appear to be warped when they get hot in the oven. They will return to their original shape when they cool down after they are taken out of the oven. Knowing what I know now, I would not purchase these pans again.', 'Title: They do the job; Content: I did jo the cheap route otherwise Id give these one less star than I did, but please take into consideration that these warm (temporarily) when heated. Its not uncommon and I was disappointed, but then they are rather cheap so I. guess I cant be too upset.', 'Title: Nice Pans but one arrived damaged; Content: Long story short, one of the pans has a manufacturing defect. The shipping was fast and that was great. The pans were individual packaged in plastic sleeves and then covered in bubble wrap. They were also next to Two cutting boards and some packaging paper. All this was in a standard amazon shipping box. The box was not beat up or damaged so shipping was not a problem I think. The pictures show the pans after I removed them from the packaging. One pan has an indent in the middle of one of the long edges and a small indent in the corner. I think these were from the manufacturing process. The pan still works well and is not warped though so one star minus.', \"Title: It's ok but not great; Content: Meets the needs but I was surprised that it warps a little in the oven.\", 'Title: Great to cook, not to bake; Content: So easy to clean and works great for sheet pan suppers. One of the pans does bend when in the oven but then flattens when cool. Not great 😫', 'Title: A bit Heavy and bends with heat; Content: It bends upon baking', 'Title: Warp under heat; Content: These pans are nice and sturdy looking until they go in the oven then “ping” they warp. Love the mirror finish and size and food cooks well in them. My only complaint is the warping when heat is applies.', 'Title: Sturdy pans but not great; Content: Warps in the oven at temperatures of 350-400 degrees. Olive oil stains required scouring to remove.', 'Title: Good value; Content: Cookies baked evenly. Pans are sturdy.', 'Title: Ok. Not for heavy duty baking; Content: Warps in oven. Kind of thin.', 'Title: Warping in oven; Content: It has good thickness. Perfect for my small oven but it warps in heat.', 'Title: Warps; Content: The sheets warp when taken out of the oven. They unwrap after cooling. The major problem is in the description, which includes the words \"heavy duty,\" which apparently they are not.', \"Title: Small, but Work; Content: These are smaller than expected and kind of bend upward on one side when in the oven, but level out fine after I take them out and let them cool down. We've been slowly getting away from Teflon, so better than nothing for the price.\", 'Title: Not for roasting temperatures; Content: Probably good for baking, but not heavy enough for higher roasting temperatures. Warps in the oven.', \"Title: Thick, shiny, measure your oven carefully.; Content: These came well packaged. Check the dimensions, my little wall oven is just barely too small because I didn't check the total width well or measure my oven's rack guides so I have to really wiggle and force them in. Fortunately they fit in lengthwise and I rotate them half way so the food cooks evenly. Warped at the 450 degree vegetable roasting, flattened back out when it cooled. If baking a cake you wouldn't be using that high temp so it shouldn't be a problem. They don't stay supper shiny but that hasn't effected sticking or cleaning. I like them.\", \"Title: Beautiful but 1 came scratched; Content: I am so happy I upgraded to these pans but am a little disappointed that 1 out of 2 came scratched 😓 I have used them in the oven and they seem to not stay hot for as long as my former plans which is great! I've also used them to stabilize my silicone pans (which flip around) and they are quite strong. I would say they scratch easily though.\", 'Title: Good value; Content: The pans do warp at high temperature, but regain their ship within in seconds of removing from the oven. I usually either use foil or a Silpat sheet in them, so cleanup is no problem', 'Title: the product will scratch easly; Content: Was very impressed when I first saw the new cookie sheets. The finish front and back is like a mirror finish. With that being said care will be needed when removing food from the sheet as it will scratch. Be sure to use plastic cookware. I rated the product 4 stars because one of the cookie sheets was dented, other then that the cookie sheets seem fine. I would order again.', \"Title: Comes up slightly short; Content: Stainless is what I wanted. The sacrifice is the size, which is a bit to small to fit the rack or cover I have from the old sheet pan I threw out. It isn't really a normal sized pan.\", 'Title: Its ok.; Content: They work,but if they get too hot they warp.,goes back to original shape. Not really easy to clean.', 'Title: Great Baking Sheet!; Content: This is a great baking sheet and its a great size for whatever your cooking! My family uses them as personal nacho trays to heat in the oven. It melts the cheese and heats up all of our food. I would definitely buy again!', 'Title: Twist when heated; Content: The only thing I dislike is that when they’re in the oven and heat up, they twist and pop up. They go back flat when they’re cool.', 'Title: Won’t warp if you preheat it; Content: I took the advice of other reviews and preheated the pan in the oven while the oven was heating up. Very minimal warping noted. The one time I didn’t do that, it warped. I’m just gonna have to get used to putting my food on a preheated pan from now on.', 'Title: Good product; Content: Used in oven on high heat at 450 degrees and has not warped. Easy to clean but do not use sponge with scouring pad as it will scratch. Overall very pleased with it.', 'Title: A little flimsy.; Content: Nice looking pans, just want them to be a little more sturdy.', \"Title: Great Product for baking; Content: Works grate for every day baking. Love that it's easy to clean.\", \"Title: Out with the teflon; Content: I despise teflon and decided to finally get rid of the last teflon in my house which was baking sheets. I was tired of baking on poison. I use stainless steel or cast iron for everything and was glad to find baking sheets made of stainless steel. I've been very happy with them. Not only are they beautiful but everything I've cooked on them has turned out lovely. I haven't seen any color changes. The food doesn't stick. Cookies come out beautifully! I was worried about them holding up but over a couple of months they seem to be fine. There is a slight bit of warping which I can deal with. They are easy to clean and really still look as beautiful and shiny as the day I bought them. Best of all- no toxins in my food and air.\", \"Title: Good product; Content: I use baking mats when I use these which Im sure makes the cleaning easier. I hand wash them instead of using the dishwasher so they have been great, idk how well they would handle in the dishwasher. Although they have bent slightly a couple times when in the oven they always straighten up after cooled. I've used them for cookies, fries, fish, and other things. Works great for all of them.\", \"Title: Non-toxic, Safe, Beautiful, PERFECT!; Content: Was searching for stainless steel as I'm ridding my home of all non-stick and plastic items for health reasons. I baked my first batch of cookies on these today and I'm really happy with this purchase. The stainless cookie sheets cooked evenly and were easy to clean. Added bonus: the mirror finish makes them really attractive, and the raised lip allows cooking of wet items without spilling.\", 'Title: Heavy Duty and easy to clean; Content: Have not baked cookies yet, but have had lots of greasy meats, veggies and it cleaned up really well!', 'Title: Excellent Quality; Content: I love these baking pans. No more teflon for me! These are good quality, safe, sturdy, stainless steel cooking sheets. They do make a bang in the oven as they warp, but upon removal return to being completely flat. They are VERY easy to clean, although anything abrasive will scratch the finish. If any food sticks, I let the pan soak in water and wipe away the food easily. I am satisfied and recommend them highly.', \"Title: Fits in my dishwasher!; Content: Love these baking pans simply because I can fit 12 cookies on them and then clean the pans in the dishwasher when I'm done. They line up great! Bought two packs, so I have 4 pans total, since I do a lot of baking and this has been wonderful for my needs.\", 'Title: Heavy duty, good value; Content: Strong with a nice high lip for large bar cookies, jelly rolls. Good size for 12 3” cookies. I have used silicone liners with cookies, light spray for panko crusted zucchini. They are stainless steel so safe, no toxic non-stick to wear out. Dawn soap and a steel scrubby will clean off everything.', \"Title: Always shines; Content: Have been using these for a few months and they are great sheet pans. Always scrub up like new with steel wool, they're sturdy, and affordable. Can't say enough bout them and will buy for my sisters for Christmas because they're bakers. Won't have the usual brown spots that seem to burn on but are impossible to get off.\", 'Title: Stainless steel is the best; Content: I bought these as a gift for my son’s family and he said they are fantastic. So easy to use cook with and clean up afterwards. They also don’t bend when cooking in oven like others made of aluminum, stainless steel is the best. Cost was very reasonable', 'Title: Heavy weight stainless steel baking pan; Content: A good price for 2 heavy weight stainless steel baking pans, no labels stick on it, shiny and pretty. I used these pans for baking rolls and fried chicken. I had another stainless steel baking pan from different brand which is not heavy weight like this but the price is more expensive and the label is stuck on the pan (no matter how you washed).', 'Title: Sturdy for a great price!; Content: I’ve worked in commercial kitchens and most everyday consumer sheet pans were flimsy and aluminum. I found these and was very excited; stainless steel at a great price! I’ve used them with some silpat knockoffs I found here as well. They’re sturdy and cleanup is easy. Great deal!', 'Title: Great cookie sheets!!!; Content: We love these. We use the sheets daily for feeding our Great Danes to slow down their eating. With all of the use and washing in the dishwasher, the pans have not rusted. I also bought some for baking and have no issues with them. I definitely recommend these!', \"Title: Better than most!; Content: This is not an aluminum pan, it's stainless steel which is in IMO a much better. We also picked up the silicone baking liners which seem to help when it's time to clean them up. All in all, we're very happy with this item.\", \"Title: Great Product that cleans easily; Content: I didn't buy this for baking cookies, I don't own an oven. But they are durable and clean very easily for what I use them for. Did notice when I used the scour side of my dish sponge it left faint scratches, but I think thats par for the course.\", 'Title: First Rate!; Content: The pans are well made, perfect for daily use in my countertop oven, or for individual sheet pies. I plan to protect their finish by avoiding cooking sprays! Excellent purchase at fine price, with prompt delivery.', 'Title: Dishwasher safe!; Content: These are great. I\\'ve had so many pans that immediately rust in the dishwasher, even if they said \"dishwasher safe\". These are holding up great. Easy to clean, durable. Recommended.', 'Title: They stayed shiny and look new after months of use.; Content: I have been using these for several months now. They are sturdy, excellent quality sheet pans. They do not warp and have remained shiny.', 'Title: perfect for needs; Content: Was perfect for new self-recipes for healthy cookies....using parchment paper will definitely extend the life of these beautiful cookiesheets. Have used them twice so far, and no complaints.', 'Title: So convenient; Content: These small sheets are convenient for making smaller batches of biscuits, cookies, roasted vegetables, etc. The perfect size for cooking for 2. These sheets cook evenly and clean easily.', 'Title: Perfect Size, Easy to Clean.; Content: I like these perfect-size pans for baking. They are also nice for roasting vegetables. They are easy to clean, but I like to use parchment sheets to make clean up even easier.', \"Title: Sturdy sheets; Content: Very nicely polished and very sturdy. Was baking my differential ring gear on it. Used the other as a tray for my LS carrier that weighs about 20 lbs..doesn't bend.\", 'Title: Very hard to clean. Not non stick.; Content: Ad said non stick. They are not non stick. They are very hard to clean.', 'Title: They Fit; Content: For the money, these are good value. What I liked most is how they fit perfectly inside my half sheet pans. The ones in the store were smaller. I put mine in the dishwasher and they seemed unaffected. My only complaint is they are a little on wire is a little thinner than I would have liked, but again the price is very reasonable. Thicker wire is available, but at a much higher cost.', 'Title: Good weight and sturdy.; Content: I like that it is larger and holds16 cookies on each rack. These racks are heavier and sturdier than the ones I had been using, and they do not slide on my counter top like my others did. The grid size is small enough that hot cookies do not break or fall through the grid. The only thing I have noticed is one of the racks is a little unbalanced but not enough to send back. Overall a good buy for the money. I would purchase these again if needed.', 'Title: Good racks, but they warp.; Content: My wife likes these, but she pointed out that they warp. There are six feet and after one or two uses, they rock on the center feet.', 'Title: Does the job; Content: It does the job fine cooling my oven baked bread, good size and pretty sturdy. I was expecting it to be a bit taller for more clearance between the table and the rack however.', \"Title: These are very well made and sturdy!; Content: I bought these to use as roasting racks when I was preparing a whole duck since they are stainless and have a center leg support for heavier items. These are tough! Very well made, work well in the oven and also as drying racks or for dry brining in the fridge. They fit perfectly on my sheet pans and don't torque or twist when handling when loaded with a large bird. My only complaint is they are a bit difficult to clean when some rendered fat get in all the webbing crevices but this isn't something there really is a solution to, it just is what it is. Overall these are great quality, well made and perform well.\", 'Title: Space saving; Content: I love these cooling racks! I have one that has folding legs on it and I though I would like how it was up off the counter but if I wasn’t careful to make sure the legs were all the way unfolded well it would collapse on one side and there would go my baked goods. I love that these are just high enough off the counter to cool everything all the way through quickly. They also don’t take up much space at all to store. Now I can’t wait to try them in the oven because I hate when my meat bakes in its juices and I have to keep soaking it up with a paper towel. I am happy with the racks all the way around!!!', \"Title: Top quality product; Content: I bought these to go with the two pack of large baking pans from Sam's and they are a perfect fit! When used as a set, they are exactly what I need for my convection/air fryer oven. Works like a charm!

A super deal for a two pack!!\", 'Title: They held upand are sturdy!; Content: I purchased these a few weeks back and was able to use them today after baking. The cooling racks are sturdy and easy to clean. I let them air dry afterwards. They are the perfect size and I would recommend them because they are so much easier to you and clean up than just leaving my baked goods on a hot baking sheet :( Never again will I be leaving stuff on the pain. I also can use these as a drip pain for greese or icing donuts!', 'Title: Sturdy and good quality; Content: I was hesitate to order because i do not want flimsy rack..

These are small enough to fit inside the tray. They seem sturdy. They are wire racks, so they are not particularly easy to clean, but that is a universal trait of that ilk.', 'Title: Large and work well; Content: These two cooling racks are large, easy to clean and are perfect for cooling cookies and cakes. I highly recommend them.', 'Title: Bacon racks; Content: Racks arrived promptly and are easy to clean after oven baking enough bacon for several days breakfast. Very pleased with them.', 'Title: Love the product!; Content: Great oven racks! Best for fried chicken!', 'Title: Where have these been all my life?; Content: Exactly what I needed for my baking sheets. Have only had them about 2 weeks and have used them a lot.

The silicone mat...... nothing stuck but the border seemed to crumble upon first use. Might try another brand without a border.', \"Title: Too large for standard oven but awesome otherwise!!!; Content: I have the smaller version which i love but this one is just too big and i wish I'd sent it back and gotten a mediumish version but alas I didn't so I now have this huge pan that is so big you can barely fit it in the oven. It is spectacular otherwise, and I love my small pans from this same company. Just to warn, it barely fits in a standard oven which means no airflow and uneven baking. Get their smaller versions unless you've got a super big oven!!!\", 'Title: Wanted stainless steel, not aluminum baking sheets and cooling racks.; Content: While deciding to clear out all aluminum, plastic, nonstick and anodized cookware, we bought stainless steel baking sheets and cooling racks.

Large and heavy.; Content: Too large to fit into my oven. More for industrial large ovens. Havent used it yet.', 'Title: Crazy Warped When Hot, Silicone Mat Melted at 450°F; Content: Original review after purchase: The silicone mats are fantastic. But the stainless steel or aluminum or whatever they are, trays, warp considerably when heated. But oddly, they do \"unwarp\" when cooled down. It\\'s great that they are totally dishwasher safe. Why can\\'t they make a product that doesn\\'t warp when heated? Update: 12/24/2019 Changing to 1 star and Do NOT Purchase. When the pans warp, the moment they \"pop\" it is so violent and abrupt it bounces the food and juices all over making a mess, then all the juices pool in the one corner. And I managed to melt and delaminate the Silicone Mat at 450°F. Please see photos. From Amazon listing: \"GUARANTEE: We have a commitment to each customer 100% satisfaction.

I just got the replacement set yesterday. Within 3 minutes of being in a preheated 350° oven the pan made a loud pop and had warped. I have had pans that returned to normal once removed from the oven, but this pan remained warped. I'll be seeking a refund this time around.\", \"Title: So disappointed; Content: I thought these were so cute with there little baking mats but I guess they shouldn't be used without the mat. I didn't use the mat because I used it to bake salmon. It is now scratched from my wood spatula. I tired cleaning it last night, didn't come clean, soaked in soapy water overnight and I still can't get it clean. Assuming I can't use anything to actually scrub it considering it's already scratching. Also it warped a little as soon as I put it in the oven.\", \"Title: Weirdly bends when heated!; Content: Your browser does not support HTML5 video. These looks very beautiful and sturdy but they bend when heated. I would not recommend to anyone. I don't know if I can return them. I don’t have the packaging. Very very disappointing. Money totally wasted.\", 'Title: Buy something else; Content: When I received these items, upon initially washing them, the red edging on the silicone mats washed away. I was very concerned about the safety of these items and did not feel they would be safe for food.', 'Title: Horrible; Content: Horrible! I would steer clear of these! I used for the first time tonight for homemade chocolate chip cookies and they were a disaster! I baked the cookies at 350 for 14 minutes and about 2 minutes into the bake they folded! So my dough ran outside the mats. Cleaning the mats and the pan was difficult.', \"Title: Warped after the very first cooking. Flimsy.

How embarrassing!\", 'Title: Would not buy again; Content: Baking sheet distorted in oven at 350 degrees', 'Title: Warped first use; Content: Within the first few minutes the pans warped at 350.

Unbelievable.', 'Title: Warped; Content: The pan warped the first time I used it.', 'Title: Does not hold to stated temperatures; Content: 2/3 mats have melted onto the pan, and so far, one of the pans has completely warped, no longer laying flat in/out of the oven.', \"Title: DO NOT BUY DANGEROUS; Content: they don't use real silicone. I had them under my oven in the drawer. Just got them 3 days ago. Silicone doesn't peel. DO NOT BUY\", \"Title: Nope!; Content: The VERY FIRST TIME I used them, they bent in the oven. Heat was only at 375 and the pan was in the oven less than 3 minutes and I heard that dreaded sound! I was livid! And because the mats are just a tad too small for each pan, the little bit of juice from the chicken went to the corner and puddled because the pan was bent up sideways and left a burnt spot on the pan itself. I was able to get it off after soaking the pan but I shouldn't have to do that, especially after just one use. Definitely disappointed!\", 'Title: Pans Warp with first use; Content: I finally got to use my pans today for my macarons after FINALLY getting my own convection oven. Being a professionally trained pastry chef I was highly disappointed. First use in the oven and my pans already started warping while in the oven making 80% of my macarons go lopsided. This is after the disappointment of getting mats that had macaron circles drawed out the size of a quarter. I honestly didn’t even know people made them that small. Living in New York City going to school I certainly never saw them that small. The mats were perfect besides that but the pans are certainly something that can’t be overlooked.

Disappointed!', 'Title: Buckled, not high quality. Would not buy again.; Content: Since I got these, I always feel like the silicone feels Sticky. I clean immediately before and after use.

Warps depending on temperature.', 'Title: Wouldn’t buy again; Content: The liners are great but the pans bend up while baking', 'Title: Baking sheet warped; Content: Large baking sheet warped really bad upon first use', 'Title: Flimsy materials.; Content: After using these for a while. They are mediocre. The thickness of the sheet pans are less than desirable. When in the oven two corners slightly pop upwards causing a slight taco shape. This will be on for some baking, nothing that requires a complete flat surface will do well on these.', 'Title: Ok but these will pop; Content: These work but they “pop” while heating so you cannot cook something that will splash.', \"Title: Do the job, and price is good.; Content: These are smaller than I would have liked so check the size before you order. The small silicone liners have been helpful although juices still run into the corners. I've started using Pam cooking spray on them before I use them so that cleanup is easier. When under the broiler there is that inevitable crack sound when the aluminum gets too hot and the pan buckles. It's always just concerting and I would have liked a better quality sheet pan that doesn't do that. All in all they serve their purpose and I am happy to use them but I would not reorder them.\", 'Title: Not as sturdy as advertised, but good overall; Content: I love that these are not aluminum. But one of the sheets warped in the oven (I had the temperature set at 450, which is supposed to be fine for this set). Other than that, so far so good.', 'Title: Kinda small; Content: I know they have the measurements but the small pan is really small. Had I really thought about it and measured it out I probably would have opted for another kind. It does wash well though and I like the cookie sheets.', \"Title: Mats are difficult to clean and will make the food taste like soap.; Content: The pans are great but the mats are difficult to clean. They stay oily even when placed in the dishwasher. When I hand wash to get the grease off, it retains the soap and makes cookies taste like the dish washing liquid. I bought these so I wouldn't have to use parchment or aluminum foil but back to using both.\", 'Title: They buckle in oven; Content: The sheet pan itself isnt good. It buckles in the oven and will not lay flat', \"Title: Nice pan but it warps; Content: These pan are okay, I had hoped for a thicker gauge steel cause they warp when in the oven at high temps. At this price point its acceptable for now. I will look into getting end high end pan that doesn't wrap.\", \"Title: Nice but unsure of long term durability.; Content: These are really beautiful when they arrive but they warp with heat. They go back to normal and the silicone cleans easily. I'm hoping they are durable!\", \"Title: Greasy cookies; Content: It was ok for non-greasy cookies. But ones with a lot of butter aren't.\", 'Title: I like Them but not overwhelmed with joy; Content: I like the silicone mats. They seem very sturdy so far as I’ve only had a few weeks. But I didn’t notice I don’t know why even though I clean them immediately it seems like there’s burnt on stains on the sides of the pans. Maybe that standard but my OCD is annoying me', 'Title: Nice set appreciate the liners; Content: This is a nice set, especially with the liners. But they do warp at 350degress.', 'Title: Purchase ok; Content: The pan warped in the oven 1st time I used it. Not very sturdy', \"Title: Great value but be aware of some few things!; Content: This was a great value to get three different size baking sheets with silicone mats included. I have used the silicone mats up to 420 degrees, and I wouldn't push it any further. They work fine. The cooking sheets aren't made out of strong, durable metal, but they're strong enough to get the job done. Also, take note of the sizes. The biggest size isn't all THAT big, so take note of that. All-in-all a great purchase though.\", \"Title: The silicone likes grease.; Content: I am thrilled with this set and use it often. The only issue I have is that silicone *LOVES* grease. Does not matter how hot the water or how much soap you use; when you rinse it off after getting it all sudsy, it's still greasy. The steel trays are much better, and thanks to the silicone liner, nothing much ever gets baked into the sheet. Food particles come right off.\", \"Title: It's a good Baking Sheet with Silicone Mat; Content: It does the job, but it takes time to clean the silicone mats from oil. The pans are OK. Since it's not very expensive, and it does the work, I'm happy with my purchase.\", 'Title: Good cooking essentials; Content: These are just what I was needing. I love the silicone sheet and the variety of sizes.', 'Title: Warped; Content: Warped after just a few minutes in the oven @400 degrees. Not as sturdy as they claim.', 'Title: Less sturdy than expected, buckles under heat; Content: Besides being slightly unsturdy, they aren’t too bad. Easy to clean, efficient', 'Title: Love my new pans; Content: Had a family get together and this made the perfect display tray of my perfectly grilled meat and veggies. The cleanup was quick. Baked some chicken nuggets and forgot to spray the pan and the cleanup was almost too easy. The sizes are perfect for everyday use.', \"Title: Warped in oven...; Content: ....but returned to normal once cooled. At least, when baking meat; I didn't see it twist when baking cookies. So I guess it couldve been worse. But I do appreciate the deal for 3 silicone mats and 3 sheets.\", 'Title: Good pans; Content: Love the pans, hate the silicone mats. Silicone mats in general just suck. It makes everything taste like soap. The pans though are great.', \"Title: Good deal; Content: I'm happy with my purchase. I use these mainly for cookies. So far so good but yes, i have noticed the pans pop sometimes.\", 'Title: Nice cookie sheets; Content: I really like these pans. They have high sides and are very sturdy. The silicone mats are pretty good. I thought the circles on the mats would be good templates for macarons like other silicone mats I have but they are not. The circles are so tiny, on the littles mat they are the size of my pinky finger tip and on the biggest, maybe the size of my thumb. Over all I do like these cooking sheets', \"Title: This is a GREAT set; Content: My last set of trays did not last very long. The non-stick surface gave out too soon. This set seems like it will last a very long time because it is completely different. This is a plain aluminum tray, with a fitted silicone liner is a great idea. The food cooks on the silicone liner, which goes into the dishwasher without a problem. (The silicone goes in the dishwasher - not the food. :) And the aluminum tray has no baked-on food, so it washes easily too. I love this combination of plain aluminum and silicon mat. I will never buy 'Teflon-like' non-stick trays again.\", \"Title: Wonderful pans; Content: I am working on a collection of recipes using small appliances for my son and my nieces and nephews. To furthe my plan l, I have purchased a 6 slice toaster oven and I needed baking sheets to fit it. I absolutely love these pans! They're gorgeous and sturdy and I am impressed by their variety of sizes. 2 out of 3 fit my toaster oven perfectly and the largest one will get plenty of use at some time in the future when I choose to use my big oven again. I heartily recommend this set to everyone!\", \"Title: The silicon pads are a BIG plus!; Content: Three really god sheet pans made even better by adding silpads with each. That's a win win! The rolled sides of the pans ensure the pan won't seize up and warp going from cool to hot and cool again with each use. If you never used silpads before you're going to love the easy cleanup and non need for wac or paper liners on the pans anymore. Easy release material doesn't melt at higher heat. Follow directions for easy use and long pan life.\", \"Title: Don't wait to buy these baking pans; Content: My old baking pans were all done doing there job. When these wonderful 3 pans arrived, I first noticed the weight. Then there were the sized to silicone pads-genius! Minimum washing. Perfect French fries, cinnamon buns and thin cut chicken cutlets. I'm looking forward to baking more with these non-stick pans. The bonus-3 different sizes. Happy cooking with these. You won't be disappointed.\", 'Title: If you broil, roast ,bake cookies ,these are for you!; Content: Excellent product not only for a convection oven, even your gas range probably even in a charcoal grill, very easy to clean sturdy not cheap well worth $25', \"Title: i do recommend; Content: i love that they are stainless steal, easy to clean and don't rust like even the no stick cookie/baking sheets. i also like having the mats it saves on the cleaning and i don't have to use the sprays that have chemicals in them that are not really good for you just so things don't stick.\", 'Title: Set of three pans with silicone mats; Content: Very nice cookie sheets with silicone Mats there are three different Sizes of cookie sheets each have a silicone mat that fits each one very high-quality I cannot wait to start baking cookies with them so I didn’t know longer have to scrape the cookies off the pans because now I have the silicone mats on each one highly recommended for any Baker', 'Title: Easy clean up; Content: I bought these after seeing them at a friends house and I’m obsessed!

These clean easy and the pans they come with have high sides which is a nice bonus.', 'Title: Great price & super easy to clean; Content: Used these already many times. Love that its super easy to clean! Less work on the clean up. Planning on buying more i love having enough pans to cook lots of food.', \"Title: 5 stars!; Content: These are amazing. I don't have to worry about stuff coming off in our food, and the silicone mats are wonderfully eco friendly.\", \"Title: The Best; Content: These are the best baking pans I've ever used! No stick and I've baked cookies, potatoes, and bbq wings on them. So easy to clean up afterwards, and very durable.\", \"Title: Wish I'd bought them sooner!; Content: The silicone sheets paired with the baking pans are perfect for biscuits, cookies, scones, etc. I love these! Wish I bought them sooner.\", 'Title: A must have for baking or cooking; Content: Best items ever..clean up is so much fast with silicone sheets', 'Title: Warped immediately; Content: All 3 of these baking sheets warped in the oven (450 degrees F). The sole reason I bought these was because I wanted to avoid the warping.', 'Title: Look good,feel sturdy, but...; Content: Looks are deceiving, still warp while in the middle of cooking. I litterally heard it, And saw it when pulled out of oven. Bends back when cooled, same as all the other cheap made cookie sheets. Also easily scratched, or else I would of returned.', 'Title: Majorly curled up in 375-degree oven; Content: The two opposite sides of the large pan curled up (not just a little bit, but about 4 inches) while it was in the oven at 375 degrees. It went flat again as it cooled down. It says on the paper accompanying the product to not contact Amazon, but to send the product back to Guangzhou China for a refund (which would cost more than the pans themselves.) Amazon is allowing me to return them without paying shipping.', 'Title: Not worth the money; Content: Used this for the first and last time tonight. I put a whole split chicken in the oven at 425. The pan warped right after I got the door closed, spilling oil and almost causing a grease fire in my oven. I can see the pan warping at 500 but not for a basic roast temperature.', 'Title: Waste of money; Content: Purchased these pans recently and used the largest and medium to roast some vegetables at 400 degrees F, a reasonable temperature by which to roast items. The pans near-immediately warped upon being put into the oven and now do not sit flat. I am extremely disappointed by these results and would NOT recommend these products. Spend a little more to get the sturdy, name-brand products. These are not worth your money or time.', 'Title: Disappointed; Content: Sheet twisted in the oven on the first use!! Such a bummer. Also looks and feels cheap and flimsy.', 'Title: Rusting and scratched up; Content: Very upset that my large and medium trays came scratched up and had rust on them.

GREAT..', \"Title: Not for Air Fry Ovens; Content: These sheets are horrible for Air Fry Ovens. Used all of them once in my GE Gas Range Air Fry 425 degrees with the racks with breaded fish, onion rings and fries. I lightly sprayed the racks and did a light wipe off of any extra cooking spray. I didn't spray the pans and that's where it went south. I couldn't remove the small drips of grease and burnt on spots off the pans. With a great amount of soaking and scrubbing the areas still wouldn't come clean. Would not recommend these racks/pans in my opinion. Homemaker for over 50 yrs.\", 'Title: These warp BIG TIME; Content: From day one, nothing but warp as soon as the get warm', 'Title: It buckles when it gets hot.; Content: I was disappointed with these trays. They looked like good quality, and I was excited to try them out. Baked 2 fish on 350F, and the tray buckled! All the juice collected in one corner. It flattened out again when it cooled, but but I am not sure I dare try to roast or use a higher temperature.', 'Title: Not worth it; Content: Got this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. The \"anti-stick\" coating does not work at all. Food sticks to the material and is extremely hard to get off. You have to scrub it so hard the coating comes off with it and gets scratched. Even with a heavy coat of cooking spray. The pans also bow when they are heated. The racks themselves are great though otherwise it would only get 1 star, if that.', 'Title: Few positives compared to overall safety; Content: Wireracks are nice, and the medium size fits a Cuisinart Toaster oven/air fryer.

We used the smallest at the same heat with no issues. Terrified of trying the middle one.', 'Title: horrible; Content: scratches easily. hard to clean. warps in the oven. just a truly terrible product.', 'Title: Dimensions not correct; Content: Outside dimensions larger than stated. Will not fit inside my toaster oven', \"Title: They are useful; Content: They are useful - size, shape, and racks. However, from Day One, there was something sticky about them and they never did wash up right. Whatever was on them have left ugly spots, even BEFORE ever using them, and those spots are sticky. WEIRD. The mirror finish is nice; and the weight is nice. But also, they are said not to warp, but they do. The do seem to go back into shape, but you can hear it while cooking and then when you peek inside the oven, you can see the pan warp. I'm using them but I can't say whether I do or don't recommend.\", \"Title: Very nice set, but large pan warps; Content: This is a really nice set that cleans up well. It fits our needs but the large pan warps when i bake bacon at 400F. I bought these specifically because they are dishwasher safe and don't warp. The smaller pan did not warp on us. But when I think about it, I used the small one at about 350F. Maybe the large one doesn't warp at 350F. I wish I can share my images, but for some reason that option is not available for this product. Oh well, I will be looking for a better half sheet now.\", 'Title: Not Stainless, thats for sure; Content: These are stained already! We oven fried some bacon on it and the bacon grease has stained the pan. they are heavy and really study, no issues warping like others have had. I wish these were truly stainless, they would have been perfect if not for this one thing!', 'Title: Product size a big deceiving; Content: I loved the product but the sizes are a bit deceiving at first. I guess I was expecting bigger upon arrival but they are tiny compared to my other ones. Two of them can fit inside my big air fryer that’s how small they are. Maybe good for one person use or two but not for a family of four when cooking in the oven. Size not true to their statement. Miniature baking sheets! Keep that in mind when purchasing.', 'Title: Nice pans, but sizes states are wrong; Content: These are nice and I really like that they came with matching cooling racks.

I am hoping to sort of mimic the type of cooking an air fryer does.', \"Title: Not what I expected.; Content: I haven't used the baking sheets yet, still deciding on whether to return them.

I'm sure if I had a toaster oven, it would be perfect for that.\", 'Title: Can’t handle the heat.; Content: When I baked fish in the large sheet it warped at 375 degrees. Once it cooled it resumed its shape. I can’t image what it will do at a higher temp.', \"Title: Better options elsewhere; Content: They're shiny pretty lookings pans but they warp horribly. When you put them cold in the oven they make this big pop sound and warp.\", 'Title: Ok; Content: These pans are just ok. The racks are easy to clean, but the pans have already bent some in the edges. Seem a little cheap.', 'Title: Good quality; Content: These pans included the racks, this was a great way to purchase cooking sheets. I am really happy with them', \"Title: Pretty, Solid, but Stains Easy; Content: If it weren't my stupid fault for not checking measurements, I'd drop these to a 3, but since I didn't actually verify the size, I'm taking responsibility here. First, the mirror finish is very nice! That is, until you cook with them once. Even putting foil down didn't prevent the biggest one from getting a little grease on it. I have-washed it and it came out cloudy, and the second time was in the dishwasher, still little imperfections started forming from just not getting it clean enough. Maybe I need jet dry, which I'm absolutely terrified if after an incident over a decade ago in which I had a drop of that stuff fly up onto my cheek. The racks are all perfect fits to their pans, and the smallest one is actually a perfect fit for my toaster oven! Great replacement for the cheap aluminum garbage that comes with toaster ovens. Particularly when you use the rack. Still doesn't leave enough space for a mini pizza, but that's virtually impossible since the toaster itself is just big enough. Honestly these would get a 5 if they weren't such a massive pain to keep clean and shiny! I worked as a dishwasher at a high-volume buffet and we had some stainless sheet pans that looked shiny again after a hand wash to get the crud off, let alone after going into the high-heat dishwasher. It's not a huge problem but part of the appeal is the mirror finish on these, and I can't see that lasting very long with how easily these get scuffed, stained, and otherwise made imperfect. Great build quality otherwise though. They're sufficiently heavy to indicate being steel, no weird issues with the extrusion or rolling, just overall well-made, but don't expect the big guy there to be a full half-sheet pan. It's good for a small roast or even bacon (seriously try making bacon with the rack, it's a thing of beauty), but it's very limiting for, say, cookies.\", 'Title: very happy; Content: These are great sheets the only problem I have is that they are already black on the outsides, yes I do use them 3 to 4 times a week but I would really have liked the stainless finish to stay, but everything I cook on them comes out great I am happy with these.', \"Title: Decent budget option.; Content: First off, make sure you check the pan dimensions. These were all a bit smaller than I thought they would be, with the smallest one being toaster oven size. They're beautiful pans when you receive them, and they've held up relatively well through a few bakings. Yes, they warp at high heat but if you think a $30 set of plans isn't going to warp, you probably need to do more research. I don't believe these are true stainless steel and for this price, I didn't expect them to be. Any grease or oil on the pans is going to stain them. If that's a huge deal, you'll want to line the pans. If you want to take the chance, you can always use baking soda to remove the buildup. I gave them 4 stars because they seem pretty durable, and for what I was expecting they work okay.. but I did deduct a star since they stain so much easier than I expected them to.\", \"Title: they're ok; Content: For the price they are adequate. 3 star quality, plus 1 for the price. basically 10 dollars a pan. They are a bit thin, they do scratch easily, and warp some at 400 degrees. of course the more weight you have on them the less they warp. They get the job done though. I bought mainly because I wanted to cook on stainless steel and not aluminum or any other possibly toxic material. I use a plastic scratch pad and dish soap to hand wash. you can also use baking soda with a little bit of water to make a paste that helps get some of the baked on stuff that wont scrub off with dish soap. I haven't put them in the dish washer yet.\", 'Title: Better than Non-Stainless; Content: Baked-on peach pie did not come off in dishwasher; required soaking and hand scrubbing. Torques when used under broiler, but mostly returns to shape when cool. Otherwise a good product.', \"Title: Useful in mutiple ways; Content: It's baking sheet, however, I used when I cook. The large one is perfect to cook steaks. And the medium and small one is good to prep for cook. I gave 4 star because, if you are not dry it as soon as when you finish wash it, it leaves water mark. But other then that I really satisfied with it.\", 'Title: They are ok.; Content: These are ok. The smallest one is smaller than a toaster oven pan. They work fine for roasting veggies and clean well. Don’t know that I would use them to to cook on.', \"Title: Nice looking but not heavy; Content: I got this to replace my Cuisinart TOA-60 aluminum tray. The mid size trays width is perfect, length is a bit shorter, so can fit a little less food. These were the cheapest I could find for a stainless steel set. It doesn't feel real heavy duty, by for toaster tray and cooling racks, seems good enough. Also used to bake a pork shoulder and a brown burn in spot I can't wash off.\", 'Title: These sheet pans are great!; Content: Theses sheet pans are great! they clean up easy and are dish washer safe. They have matching racks that go with them.', \"Title: Good; Content: I've used these pans on multiple occasions and while they can be a little tough to clean every other aspect is very good. Having the different sizes is also very helpful for different types of cooking.\", \"Title: Well made with good heft.; Content: Doesn't seem to wrap in a hot oven like cheaper pans. Good value for the quality.\", 'Title: Good range of sizes; Content: I like having the options of having small to medium sized baking sheets.

That’s not what I got. I received 2 same size trays with racks. I like them, but not what I ordered.', 'Title: Great cookware; Content: Very useful if you want to cook something in the oven and not worry about the bottom of what your cooking becomes soggy or soft. Very good if you want something to cook crispy without the fluids i.e. bacon. You can set it on the grill while the sheet collects all the extra grease. Leaving your bacon with lease grease and crispy from top to bottom.', 'Title: Decent set of pans; Content: I use the largest one to cook whole spatchcocked chicken. It has held up well, but warps a bit in the oven', 'Title: Worth buying again.; Content: Like many people I have an assortment of baking pans, most are old aluminum stained permanent brown. and all with no cooling rack. I looked for hours, reading one review after another. I picked these because of many favorable reviews, and the couple of not so favorable reviews. These are good stainless that clean up very well. Used properly they do very well in the oven. As with most pans , these can warp a bit at high heat, especially under the broiler. When cooled down again they flatten right out. They feel sturdy, and clean up with a sponge if you presoak any burned on food. As I said, they are worth buying again.', 'Title: Good and sturdy; Content: I really liked using these sheet pans to roast my turkey (I cut it up, seasoned and then baked them in these pans) the sizes are alright, I noticed that the heat (can’t remember what temperature) kind of warped the pan a little as it baked. Once I took it out it went back to normal. Some people are dummies and put them in the dishwasher.... don’t do that. Just clean it with something not so abrasive, it’s quick and easy and you take better care of the product. I use these for many things and I like having a small sized pan.', 'Title: Awesome baking sheets with size matching racks!; Content: OMG, this set of 3 baking sheets with size matching racks is INCREDIBLE. I would recommend this set as an awesome gift, i.e. wedding, bridal shower, etc.', 'Title: Wonderful!; Content: I am really impressed with these little pans. I bought them to bake bacon. I liked that each pan has its own wire tray. I find the trays to be sturdy and am finding I use all of them way more than I thought I would. I can place fried foods on the smallest one and leave in a warm oven while finishing cooking other parts of the meal, and all stays crunchy. At high temps (broiling, which is above the temp recommended for this pan set) I have heard the biggest one “pop”, but upon cooling, it returns to flat. Other reviews complain about difficulty cleaning, but I have found the opposite. I find that no matter how much stuff appears to be crusted on the pan, a little dishwashing liquid, and a soak in hot water (just fill the pan), place the crusty tray upside down in the hot water, and about ten minutes later, super easy to wash away, almost like nonstick surface. I have been shocked and pleased. They come out of my dishwasher looking shiny and bright when I run them through there. (We do have a water softener, so complaints that they lose their pretty finish may be due to hard water or different ph than what we have?) but honestly they are so easy to wash by hand with a short soak, I generally just let them drip dry after, and all good. I would highly recommend these pans.', \"Title: So incredibly you'll wonder how you survived without them; Content: Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my new baking sheets with racks! They're incredibly sturdy and easy to clean. I just used the smallest set (omg it's so adorable) to brown my bananas for Banana Bread and my 3 bananas fit perfectly! (See pics). The largest size fits perfectly in my WARING CONVECTION OVEN. I love the 3 different sizes and how I cam use the pans or racks so many different ways. In fact, I used the rack as a cooling rack for my banana bread when I was done (see pic). As I continue to use my pans I will update if the durability is anything less than the 5☆ I just gave. Highly recommend. I will purchase more.\", \"Title: Easy Clean; Content: I am surprised how much I like these pans. Typically, I don't have a lot of time to soak, scrape, wash, place in the dishwasher, etc. These pans are great for an easy clean. I also like the sizes. Perfect for personal Naan pizzas or Oven-Roasted Chicken. Great buy!\", 'Title: So easy to air fry; Content: We have an air fryer and then i decided to get these trays because in the air fryer there is only so much you can out in at once. They work just like an air fryer!!! Perfect 3 sizes fit the current need.', 'Title: The Best Ever!; Content: I am not quite sure why they call these Baking Sheets, I use them for everything such as broiling a steak, roasting a chicken breast, baking ribs and pork chops, lamb ribs, etc. What is remarkable is they are so easy to clean including the rack. One might think that they are too shallow, not the case in my cooking but I must say I do not cook for a large family. I would certainly recommend them for a single person or couple. I have also given them as gifts. Wish that I had had these years ago.', \"Title: Excellent sheet pan set; Content: I wanted a set of fully-rimmed sheet pans because the ones I have are rimmed only on 3 sides which makes them not as useful for some types of cooking. These are great, especially because the smaller ones actually fit in my toaster oven, which I use even more than I do my regular oven. I have not had them long so it's hard to comment on their durability but they are easy to clean and work very well. I have not had any issues with them warping even at high heat (450 F). I am very happy with my purchase.\", \"Title: Durable; Content: I waited a while to write this review because I bought these with no intention of babying them. So after several months I have put them in the dishwasher, used metal serving utensils on them, left them soaking over night in the sink. So far so good, no rust no scratches. I may just throw out all my baking sheets and replace them with these. Yes they do warp at about 425ish, I have yet to find to a cookie sheet that doesn't.\", \"Title: Tested and I am satisfied!; Content: I purchased these items as pans to drain fried foods but decided to try some Pillsbury CCC on it. I was thoroughly impressed because when you lift the pan; it's very lightweight. This would've been fine for what I was using it for but hey I threw caution to the wind and I am very happy with this purchase. I would definitely recommend it for baking or using it to drain the grease from fried foods!\", \"Title: Worth buying!; Content: I only use this whenever I'm making sheets cake or baking rolls or cookies. I don't use it for baking meat. I bought this specifically just for my pastries and breads. It's very shiny and you can use it as a mirror if you wanna see if you have any flour on your face LOL 🤣 Very sturdy, and a little heavy. My husband approved it too.\", 'Title: Very Nice baking sheets; Content: Purchased these baking sheets because they came with racks. They’re very sturdy with a nice shinny finish and not flimsy at all. I’ve been impressed with them so far. We’ll see how will the hold up. Only downside is they recommend hand washing', \"Title: nice; Content: These baking sheets with rack set work extremely well for the home cook who is not looking for professional grade. They seem sturdy enough, the racks work efficiently enough, the sizes are 3 separate individual sizes the racks fit in the pans. If you're looking for a pot of gold these are not it but they work for what I purchased them for. I will be using these for years to come.\", \"Title: Love, Love, Love these; Content: These are awesome! They come clean so very easily. My husband roasted asparagus on it, the drippings got all burned on the sheet pan, came off with minimal scrubbing! I gave a 4 for durability because, the little legs on the racks cause marks that don't come off on the sheet pan.\", 'Title: Great Pans!; Content: I really love these pans! I am going to throw out some of the old pans, and use these for sure! Going to look at this brand for other options as well.', 'Title: Very good item; Content: This is my second set of these I have purchased.

I tried using the slicer attachment and it barely worked. It bent very easily. I was better off just using the one on my cheese grater.

I\\'m really disappointed, because the bowls themselves are great - the size selections, the sturdiness, and the anti-slip grip on the bottom - but it had been the lids that made me choose this product over other brands on Amazon.', 'Title: Bowls are good. Color is off. Lids not airtight.; Content: Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought the Khaki. First clue of quality was that they misspelled their own brand name on the box. Second clue was that the color of the silicone bottom and lids do not match. The silicone is khaki while the lids are more of fleshy pink. Third is the lids are not airtight. First bowl of freshly cut pineapple in the fridge overnight turned brown. Tried the large bowl with the optional grater attachment and every time I try to seal it closed that middle section pops right up/off.

No color differences like shown in other reviews. Also, all the lids have a great fit and are airtight. HOWEVER, the large lid, which I would be using the most, looks like it’s been dragged outside on the ground -___- I will not be returning but will contact seller to see if I’m able to get a replacement. I will give you an update.', \"Title: Just ok - you get what you pay for.; Content: These bowls are on the thinner side. They definitely scratch very easily and the lids are hard to seal and pop off once I get them on. I'm not able to use them for what I purchased them for but they work for mixing pasta and salads.\", \"Title: Lids suck; Content: Awesome bowls and works great. But the lids suck. You can't put them on. The air pressure from inside pushes the lid back up. You literally have to punch a small hole in the lid to be able to close them. The grater lid is fine. Just none of the ones meant to seal food.\", 'Title: Possible buy.; Content: The bowls are good but need larger sizes and they don’t store within each other like depicted in the picture.', \"Title: Great bowls; Content: The bowls themselves are fine The lids don't fit so well But all in all if you're using them just for the bowls would recommend\", \"Title: Not very easy to clean, stain easily.; Content: Even though these bowls and sturdy and very practical to use, they're hard to clean and stain very easily. If I was not past the deadline to return, I would've returned them. I have other stainless steel bowls that don't get stained this easily.. It is quite unfortunate as the sizes are perfect and useful and it goes well with my kitchen.\", 'Title: Lid doesn’t close on container; Content: As mixing bowls, these are great because the rubber in the bottom makes them less likely to move while in use or in storage. As an airtight concealer, these fail and miss the mark completely.

Be careful if you have anything hot in the large bowl and your using the lid, the center doesn’t fit well. When I received the box it was torn all to pieces and bowls where sitting opened in the raggedy box.', 'Title: bowls; Content: The bowls are great but the graders are really flimsy', 'Title: Would not have bought them if they were in a store; Content: These are okay, the lids are a bit cheap. I probably would not have bought them in a store.', \"Title: Good except for one problem; Content: First the good: These bowls are well made and sturdy, and their shape is perfect for providing plenty of room inside. The variety of sizes is excellent. They are attractive enough to serve things in, so things like salads can go right from the refrigerator to the table. Their bases are color coded to match their lids, so it's easy to grab the right one. The bowls all nest inside each other. Now the not good: The lids don't fit tightly. Even if I press them down firmly, the moment I let go they pop up. Not all the way off, but definitely not properly sealed. I'm really disappointed about that. I'm still within my 30-day return window, so I'm debating if this is a deal breaker for me. Update: Yup, it's a deal breaker. No matter how hard I press the lids on, they pop right up. Not all the way off, but loose enough that they don't seal and you can smell the food in them in the refrigerator. I'm replacing them.\", 'Title: Great bowls lids are OK; Content: The bowls are amazing they have silicone non slip bottoms. Measuring etching on inside don’t know how accurate but they do have them. They do scratch at least the shiny inside of bowls if you don’t use anything but silicone utensils. Don’t mind the scratches as they still function. As far as the LIDS they are OK. Literally that. As soon as I got the bowls some lids were kind deformed and didn’t fit as nice as I though. They claim the product is dishwasher safe and my lids got even more deformed. Might be my fault as I had the wash cycle on hot and steam sanitize. So take with a grain of salt. Graters are okay as well. I think when your buying this product your really paying for the bowls. Not lids and graters. Regardless if I’d have to buy another set I’d buy them again. $35 for some nice bowls isn’t bad at all. 4 stars (4.5 if I could) cause lids and graters are OK.', 'Title: A nice set of bowls; Content: Great set of bowls with well fitting lids. Kept my homemade coleslaw crisp for five whole days while with other containers is goes mushy in just three days. The rubberized bottom keeps them from sliding around, very useful when grating things! My only complaint is about the grater attachments. They seem a little flimsy and should have some kind of lip or handle to help get them out of the lid because the whole lid has to come off in order to get the attachment out of the lid.', 'Title: Replaced my old mixing bowls with these...; Content: Saw these at my MIL’s house and loved them so I got a set for myself. Great for whipping something up, popping the top on, and heading to a cookout, picnic, etc. The only drawbacks I have encountered are 1) it takes a little extra effort to “pop” some of the tops on but, once it’s on, you’re good to go. 2) the shiny finish means mixing in the bowl with a metal utensil is going to leave you with very noticeable scratches. If you can live with that or resort to using rubber spatulas then these are great bowls. On the plus side, they nest away in the cabinet and the rubber bottoms keep the bowls from slipping and twirling all over your workspace.', 'Title: The large bowl seems flimsy, but the rest of the set is good.; Content: I’ve only used the large bowl a handful of times, but while shredding cheese with the cut-out lid feature, the bowl split. I was disappointed as I thought this was a quality set. I’m very happy with the rest of the set! I’m not sure how to initiate a return/replacement.', \"Title: Overall great mixing bowls; Content: Overall, I love my new mixing bowls. However, the small lid for the big bowl does not fit properly nor does it fit the graters correctly. I didn't want to return and have the exact same problem with a new set, and just kept this one. I use them pretty much daily. I would recommend using wooden or silicone spoon instead of metal ones because it does cause scratches. I had them for a little over two months and I like them.\", \"Title: Nice set, but lids don't close; Content: Lightweight, great rubber bottoms to avoid slipping. Lids do not fit into the bowls well. May be better for prepping & cooking than for storing.\", 'Title: Super handy; Content: On the one hand I love them and the lids and the cheese grater pop in top option. I love the color. On first use with hand mixer the bowl was covered in swirl scratches. So the metal isn’t super strong- but the rest makes it totally worth the buy!', 'Title: Quality set; Content: Great set of bowls. The grater and slicer insert work great. The rubber outer bottom is both good and bad. I can not set the bowl on the grill to melt or heat up stuff. Yet it is nice not to have to chase the bowl on the counter.', 'Title: Overall good!; Content: These are great and I love the attachments for grating veggies! The only complaint I have is to make sure you hand wash as much as possible. Especially the lids. They don’t fit great to begin with and they will start to warp.', \"Title: Solid value for money; Content: The lids aren't the most high quality, but at least there are lids and I like the fact that there are the attachments. Solid all in all. Not mind blowing, but definitely keeping it.\", 'Title: Satisfactory Set of Bowls; Content: This product is a nice set of stainless steel mixing bowls. I was looking specifically for a set with a variety of sizes, which this has. I liked that the set was tall, rather than wide like many sets. I also wanted a set with lids, and this set had the graters/slicer as an additional bonus. The one disappointment was the stiffness of the lids. They fit well, but I would have preferred a bit more flexible material. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase.', \"Title: Useful size bowls.; Content: I love the different size bowls and the grip they have on the bottom of the bowl to prevent slipping. I use them for preparing food and then storing food in the fridge and the different sizes are very convenient. My only complaint is that the lids don't fit that well. You have to jam them on and even then sometimes they pop back off.\", 'Title: Good bowls so-so lids; Content: Love the bowls and the rubber bottom keeps them from sliding around in the counter when cooking. Easy to clean. Wish lids were more of a rubber instead of plastic though. Light weight', \"Title: Scratches easy with hand mixer/lids may shrink in dishwasher; Content: They scratched very easy when I used my hand mixer in it. Which sucks! Also the smallest size container came with a lid that doesn't fit!! So that was kinda disappointing...I use them for storage and mixing to-be baked items. Over all 4/5 for the soft metal used to make it.\", 'Title: Good value product with measured expectations; Content: I have been searching for metal mixing bowls, and this set of 5 seems to be a good value. It\\'s very similar to other products offered online. The bowls are of good quality, and the non-slip base does a good job. The lids have inserts for grating discs, which is also a great concept and time saver. The downside is that the lids, as other users have mentioned, are on the \"plasticky\" side and will no doubt break down in time. I don\\'t expect them to last very long, but that\\'s the tradeoff for the great price I paid. I was going to buy the metal bowls without lids, so I figure these lids to be freebies that I will use as long as they last.', \"Title: Great bowls!; Content: The only thing we would like to see improved is the fit of the lid. We don't put the bowls or lids in the dishwasher so can't understand why the lids don't stay on.\", 'Title: Extremely pleased; Content: From reading the reviews I was a little unsure but went ahead and bought the set. I am extremely pleased with the look of the products the seal of the product. The lids are not overly flimsy (as one review stated) they’re just enough to make it an airtight seal, so it’s perfect. The grater attachments go on the lid of the big bowl. I was unsure if it came with a plug so it can be sealed also, I’m awesomely happy to say it does. I can take it to a party, family get together or somewhere else and not have to worry about it leaking. I have not used it yet but look forward to doing so. The only concern I have is using a handmixer and what it will do to the stainless steel.', 'Title: Great product!; Content: I have always wanted a set of stainless steel mixing bows, and I managed to choose these really good ones! They are lightweight, very easy to clean, (the bowls are dishwasher safe), weighted on the bottom so there is no need to wish for a third hand to hold the bowl (it also will not scratch counters), and they store food in them will tight lids. I really like that the larger bowl has a place in the center to put 1of 3 graters (I didn’t have a grater either! 😮) Also, there are marks inside the bowls to show how much food/liquid is in it. You can’t go wrong with these pretty mixing bowls.', 'Title: Perfect for everything!; Content: Awesome and good for the price! I needed to replace some old plastic mixing bowls and got these ones because they were stainless with the rubber bottom and because of the grater inserts (total game changer!). When I got them I was surprised because they were much narrower and taller than my old plastic ones which were wider and shallower, but turns out it’s actually super beneficial to have taller bowls. They even have measurement ticks on the inside.', 'Title: Pleasantly surprised.; Content: I went to pick up the box from my front doorstep and I could immediately feel more weight than I had anticipated. I was very pleased with the sturdiness and obvious quality of the bowls. Far better than I had hoped, well worth the price.', 'Title: Fantastic Bowls; Content: Do I ever LOVE this bowl set!!!!!! Super happy I bought these. Bowls are nice and big, fitting lids and I like how you can slice or grate cheese from the top of the big bowl right into it. Definitely would recommend these to the man/woman of the kitchen!!!!', \"Title: Nice to have lids; Content: Lids fit well and it is nice to have measurements on the side of the pans. Great bowels don't slide either. I recommend highly\", 'Title: Extremely useful set of mixing bowls; Content: Loved the flexibility of these bowls and how easy they are to nest and store. They were purchased as a gift and the recipient loves them.', 'Title: Old looking box - but great looking bowls; Content: The box looks like its from the 70\\'s and I can\\'t verify that its not actually out of some dusty warehouse. But, the bowls are good quality and very good value. The wife loves the grater option, which makes grating cheese or whatever so convenient. Grating horizontally seems easier than up and down and the large bowl gives you plenty of room to catch a huge amount of grated \"whatevers.\" Only con is that you can\\'t actually see how much you\\'ve grated. If you are going by weight, no problem, just weigh it first and grate till its gone.', \"Title: Excellent bowls, Covers not that great; Content: I absolutely love these bowls. They are very sturdy and the rubber base helps keep them from sliding while mixing items. In fact, I sometimes forget they don't slide and almost knock them over when I try to slide one across a counter but that's my fault. The one problem I have is that the covers do not fit all that well and are almost impossible to close and seal the contents. But since I do not use them for storage all that much it is not a major issue.\", \"Title: Awesome Mixing Bowls; Content: I love everything about these mixing bowl! They are so useful to mix things in and store it. I love that when I'm not using them, they nest together to save room. They're really easy to clean, too.\", 'Title: loving this set; Content: these are the best the lids fit properly they clean easy and they stake into each other save a ton of space. one of the lids has a secondary lid that comes off so you can add the cheese grater which works great very impressed by the grater. 1 less thing i need in my kitchen saves more space. also if you are mixing at a high speed i found that my mixer fits into the hole so no more splatter super great. after using i bought a set for my daughter who lives in a studio she also loves them great space savers easy to clean . she really likes the non slip bottoms which also protect her counter top. and reduces noise.', \"Title: I Love These Bowls!; Content: I needed a new set of mixing bowls, and I figured, bowls are bowls. Wrong! These bowls have some fantastic features that totally set them apart from run of the mill bowls. First there's the rubber coating on the bottom, which keeps them from slipping on the counter. Then there's the measurement guide on the inside of each bowl, so you can see the quantity of your ingredients. Then there's the great fit of the lids. Then there's the ability to insert grating discs into the center of the largest bowl cover (I haven't actually tried this feature yet). I couldn't be happier with this wonderful find!\", \"Title: Nice quality bowls and lids; Content: Purchased these to be primary mixers and left over storage. The bowls are well made and weighted bottoms with nice anti-slip rubber bottoms. Dishwasher safe.... once nice feature I didn't see when I purchased was the larger lid comes with an insert in which you can put slicer, grater and other attachments on. That was a nice surprise. I think for the price these are great and will last a long time. We will see how they hold up in the dishwasher over time and report back if any issues pop up.\", 'Title: No mor slipping or sliding bowls!!; Content: I love these bowls. They have measured lines inside to help you with your ingredients. The padding in the bottom keeps the bowls in place while storing or mixing. No more sliding bowls or tip overs. The only thing I can say against them is you can’t put them in the dishwasher. But small price to pay for all other advantages that come with these bowls. I would recommend them to anyone!!', \"Title: PERFECT SIZE; Content: Worth purchasing. The stainless steel material is strong and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. The covers fit snug and keep my food fresh for long periods of time. Great for prepping and seasoning meats and vegetables, or beating eggs for breakfast. Haven't used the graters yet but I do wish they could be used with the smaller bowls - grating something like fresh mozzarella cheese doesn't need that much space in my opinion. So just keep in mind that the graters are for more heavy duty cooking. Incredibly easy to clean. Love that the bottom has rubber to keep the bowls from sliding around. The bowls were a bit smaller than expected based on the pictures but after using them, I realized that they're perfect for my space and what I need.\", \"Title: Great Quality for the price; Content: I liked that they are stainless and have the soft silicone bottoms. They don't shift or move when you use them; they stay in place as you mix/stir. The product came as described and everything nestles neatly in the larger bowl, so it doesn't take up much space. Sturdy but not too heavy that cooking becomes laborious. Two thumbs.\", \"Title: Doesn't get much better!; Content: Great bowls, covers and the silicon bottom is great! The value is unbelievable. I bought my daughter some that are similar from Pampered Chef that were 3x the cost and these are better. Much better. Great gift that screams expensive and only you know what you paid. So do yourself a favor, and buy some for yourself too!\", 'Title: Great product.; Content: I absolutely love this set. There is a downside for me.. (might just be my set defect) The pink lid- the middle insert piece that you inner change is loose. I have to hold the pieces with one of my hands and use it as I go. More annoying than unusable.', \"Title: mixing bowls; Content: boxes from manufacturer weren't very sturdy and since I ordered for Christmas presents I'm disappointed. I'm also disappointed that Amazon's fulfillment center didn't check to make sure product wasn't damaged and just shipped anyway, since box was sooooo damaged. SMH. That's why I prefer shopping in a store instead of on line. All in all I am happy with the product just have to find another box to wrap it in.\", 'Title: Awesome Stainless Steel Bowls; Content: These bowls are awesome! There is a rubber bottom which keeps the bowl in place. I have used the lids when I make something that needs to be refrigerated or saved for later.

I highly recommend this product.', \"Title: Stainless; Content: Unlike plastic bowls, they don't stain and are easy to clean.\", \"Title: Lid!

Other than that, they seem fine.', 'Title: Beyond disappointed; Content: Was so happy when I got them about 2.5 weeks ago. They look great and store a lot. Except one just broke!! The wings on the one of the lids that should clip down to create an airtight seal, just completely broke off out of nowhere. So sad now.', 'Title: Poor quality.; Content: Lids are not secure after a few uses. Waste of money.', 'Title: Lids are flimsy and cheap; Content: Lid broke after first use and after I already put a decal on it. Hope the others one last but not feeling optimist. At least Amazon was great and sending replacement but crossing fingers they will hold up.', 'Title: Nice cansters; Content: Very well made and durable. The only downside I see is that the lids have to be locked down on all four sides. Kind of time consuming.', \"Title: Lids DON'T close!!!!!!; Content: This is my first time writing a review of a product on Amazon. I thought these looked excellent an the size were ideal for what I was looking for. However, the lids are horrible. Non of the lids would seat properly, not even one. I'm not sure if this is a manufacturer's defect or the product itself. I will attempt to send them back and get a refund and go with something else.\", 'Title: Lids won’t stay on; Content: These were great at first. Now the kids won’t stay on or seal. We have only hand washed both the lid and the bowl. Not sure what happened but it is extremely annoying.', \"Title: Bowl has a hole!; Content: My husband spent hours reading reviews and finally settled on these bowls to get me for Christmas. After using them for barely over a month we noticed that one of the bowls has a hole in the bottom! They scratch incredibly easily and are not sturdy at all. The lids also don't seal as advertised. Unfortunately we noticed the hole two days after the return window closed.\", 'Title: Don’t buy; Content: Most lids don’t fit. I didn’t try to see if they fit before I washed them in the top rack of my dishwasher (don’t even use drying option so it doesn’t get too hot).

These ain’t it. These were tinny cheap junk. Returned immediately. Also, the biggest bowl is REALLY ridiculously big!', 'Title: Lids don’t fit securely!; Content: I purchased these after seeing a buzzfeed with a similar product that has colorful lids- I bought these because they were slightly cheaper but you get what you pay for. None of the lids fit securely which defeats most of their purpose.

I reached out to the company to resolve the issue due to this being a wedding gift and had no response.', 'Title: You’ll be sorry 😢; Content: Yes or no we are near as nice as the Wolfgang Puck bowls.

It worked perfect for that but when I went to clean it, I realized that the whisk had left tons of scratches on the bottom and I was hoping whatever scratched off didn't get in my cookies. Also the lid for the largest bowl doesn't fit. I wanted a nice bowl set and this was NOT IT.\", \"Title: Lids don't fit when cold; Content: I noticed that other users took issue with the lids not fitting properly. Mine fit fine when I received the set, and still do--except when put in the refrigerator. The only thing I can think to attribute this to is that the lid shrinks more than metal bowl when chilled, which doesn't make much sense to me. When cold, the lid becomes warped and won't stay sealed on the bowl. Even when you try to press it on and back into shape. When both come back to room temperature the lid seals nicely once again. Go figure. Other than that, the bowls are very nice looking and have a nice finish; however, they do scratch up very easily on the inside if you plan on doing much whisking or using a hand mixer. I love the rubberized base, which provides great stability when you tilt the bowl during whisking or mixing. I can only give this product two stars based on the lid issue.\", 'Title: Great bowls, but.....; Content: The bowls are great! i especially love the large bowl, but the lids are a joke. They do not close, keep popping up and after the first run in a dishwasher they look almost warped. Just horrible!

I am considering taking a metal file and gently filing away some of the edges of the lids to see if that fixes the issue, but I doubt it will. I cannot recommend this product because of these defects.', \"Title: Don't buy, if good fitting lids are important to you; Content: The bowl themselves are fine, no problem with them, but I didn't just buy them for the bowls. I needed bowls with lids, that's where the problem comes in, out of five bowls, only one has a lid that fits, the other ones are either to tight and won't stay close or to loose and doesn't make a tight seal. I wish I hadn't been so quick to throw away the packaging. I paid for five bowls, but find myself only using the one with the good fitting lid.\", 'Title: Lids are horrible!; Content: I love the stainless steel bowls but HATE the lids as they do not fit or close properly.

However, the lids warp in the refrigerator and the bowls scratch very easily inside. I suggest using wooden spoons or the gentle rubberized kitchen tools. If today wasn't the last day to return them I would return them. $40.00 was too much for the compromise I have to make for the poor quality.\", 'Title: Bummer; Content: I\\'ve never actually written a review before but I was really disappointed with this product so I figured this time I should. I received the bowls and they appeared nice and the lids fit tight on the first use. Once I removed the lids from the bowls they no longer stayed snug and just popped off.

You have to fight with it to try and get a good deal and half the time it pops open again', 'Title: Fantastic! At first...; Content: Fantastic set. Great depth so ingredients won’t spill over the edge. The non slip bases help to improve ease of baking and less wear on muscles. However, I was really hoping to use the lids for storage and baking and the larger ones don’t fit. I’ve already used them so I can’t return them', \"Title: Regrettable Purchase; Content: Nice bowls but find we don't use them much. Main issue is the lids simply will not stay sealed. This is on ALL the bowls. If you are looking at these for mixing/measuring bowls they are sufficient. If you want to use these for storing and keeping food fresh these will not work.\", \"Title: Bowls are ok, but not one of the lids fit; Content: Overall these bowls are okay. The different sizes are nice and the rubber bottoms come in handy. I've only used them once though and the interior is already showing scratch marks despite the fact that I used rubber tools to mix. Also, not one of the lids fits properly on the bowls so essentially they are useless. If you're looking to use the lids, do not buy these bowls.\", \"Title: Lids do not work properly; Content: I bought these specifically for the lids, and the lids do not function properly.

I saw glowing reviews -- but also, that some consumers had issues with the lids fitting properly. While I am pleased with the overall quality of the bowls, I am having difficulty getting the lids to stay on and seal. They tend to pop off, leaving the food exposed to the air, affecting the content's freshness. If you are looking for some good quality stainless steel mixing bowls and the lids are not a consideration, I'd advise ordering this set without the lids as they are basically useless.\", 'Title: The lids though...; Content: I love the bowls but hate the lids. The lids do not tightly stay on. They are always popped up on one side. I’m not sure if it’s a big enough deal to return them yet. I do love the different sizes and that they nest into each other. I also enjoy the silicone bottom. Just wish those damn lids stayed on.', 'Title: cracks; Content: I was in love with these bowls. they are perfect and just what I needed. until about 2 days ago. I put some food away in the fridge to marinate and when I took it out a saw a tiny crack on the rim of the bowl. I ignored it, it was tiny. then today im washing it and notice 2 more cracks on the other side of the bowl that arent tiny at ALL, theyre actually starting to ride down the side of the bowl. its one thing if these bowls were banged around and all but I barely cook so i hardly use them. this might have been my 3rd time using them and I usually use the biggest bowl to marinate my foods. my biggest and smallest bowls take most of the beatings. this may have been why first time using the 5qt bowl in the fridge and it cracked. side note, I never put these in the dishwasher, as im afraid the rubber would separate from the bottom. these are hand washed, well taken care of bowls.', \"Title: poor quality control, but overall I like them; Content: The large bowl had 3 metal shards under the rim which sliced my finger in two places after I removed the bowl from packaging. I was able to use needle nose pliers and remove the long metal threads, but this shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. Also, two of the smaller bowls have some dings and dents in the rims. Other than these issues, the bowls are lovely and seem very sturdy. Maybe I am missing something, but I am not sure how the largest bowl is an 8 qt as advertised. The inside measurement goes to 6 qts with about an inch to go to the rim, which would be a 7 qt in my estimation. I like the bowls enough to keep them and not send them back.\", \"Title: Lids are a gimmick; Content: Originally had 5 stars for these and bumped down to 3 :( Loved the bowls when i first got them. Made sure all the lids fit when i first opened the box and didn't have any issues for the past 2 months of having them. When I was packing up left-overs from thanksgiving, NONE of the lids fit on the bowls. The bowls and lids have NEVER been in the dishwasher and I always made sure to wash the lids with lukewarm water to make sure any extreme heat didn't mess with them. The weirdest thing is that I haven't even used every lid other than initially double checking that each one fit when i first received them so they all stopped fitting at the same time? Very bizarre.. I will say though that I do really like the bowls. The fact that they nest into each-other for easy storage and the bottoms are silicone makes working with them in the kitchen super nice since i don't have to worry about them sliding all over the place or scratching anything up. Just wish I didn't pay extra for lids that don't fit.\", \"Title: I do love the design and theory behind it with LIDS!; Content: I have not been able to use these all as of yet.

I should however check the rest of them and see and make sure that they don't do the same thing.\", 'Title: Price, quality; Content: Bowls are fine, but the lids do not fit well on top to stay sealed.

She really liked them other than the lids not fitting well at all. They don't snap shut. We followed the instructions on how to push in the middle until the air came out and then the sides repeatedly. Will keep them because they are nice for the variety of sizes and she broke her plastic ones, but it would be nice if the lids actually fit snug. We took some salsa to a bbq and ended up spilling it in the car because the lid would not stay on.....\", \"Title: Lids do not fit new out of the box; Content: I do like these bowls, but I also paid more for this set because they had lids. I could have gotten a six bowl set for less money. I can confirm that as soon as I opened this package the lids do not fit, so this is not related to putting them in a dishwasher. If you put them on they will slowly or quickly, depending on the size, pop back out again. They will technically fit, so maybe you could tape them down if needed.... hah I do like the actual bowls, and the rubberized bottoms are a nice touch, so I will not be returning them. I wanted to write a review because when I read though the others it seemed unclear if the lid issue was related to dishwasher use or not. To sum it up, if you like the rubber bottoms and aren't concerned about using the lids, these are a good buy. They seem solid and well made. I also like how they're deeper than a lot of the other ones I looked at. Everything, including the useless lids, stack together nicely.\", 'Title: Be careful! Rims are sharp!; Content: Ouch!!! I cut my finger as soon as I removed them from the box. The underneath side of the rim on one of the bowls is super sharp, not smooth at all. These are going to have to go back if the manufacturer can’t send me a replacement for that bowl since it’s one of the sizes that would be used most often. These are pretty light weight compared to other sets I have, but I like the depth and non-skid bottom.', 'Title: Disappointed; Content: These bowls are made well. But the main reason I bought them was to cover the food for refrigeration. The lids do not fit the bowls. I have tried different ways, but they will not stay down below the lip. It was very disappointing. I ended up not using the lids and using plastic wrap to cover the food if I have to refrigerate it. I would not recommend buying these bowls for this reason', 'Title: Awesome Bowls, Bad Lids; Content: These bowls are so nice, they are not thin and “tinny”. The walls are sturdy and the rubber like bottoms are quiet and keep them from slipping. The lids are so nice fresh out of the box, but after a trip through the dishwasher it’s over and you’re back to using plastic wrap for covers. The stacking feature and lids were a huge reason why I chose this set. Love the bowls. As you can see, the lids failed. The company should replace every last lid set', \"Title: Bowls are good, lids are not; Content: So I knew that I might run into lid issues from reading previous reviews.

If you need the lids to be closed tightly - these are not for you.\", \"Title: Love the sizes, not the overall quality; Content: After looking at several different stainless steel bowl sets on Amazon, I settled on this set because it contained a large 8-qt bowl. The bowls look nice and the non-slip base is a great addition however I noticed that there was a scratch inside the large bowl and what look like rust spots on the inside and outside of the 2-qt bowl.

I love (OATLY) oat milk but I don't trust what's in it so to be sure I make my own. This largest bowl allowed to nail down my recipe. I combine oat milk with cashew milk. Long story short, I love the esthetic of the bowls ( they still look brand new), the stability from the silicone base, the easy storage of nestled bowls I wish there was a way to buy the lids that have the holes for small dics for grating ect. I have changed my review 3 times and the quality of the bowls won out. I hope the manufacturing company reads reviews & helps me with my lids.\", \"Title: Love the bowls (even if lids don't fit properly); Content: The bowls themselves are terrific -- silicone base really helps to keep bowl in place on counter while I mix and prepare ingredients in them. The slight down side is that, much to my surprise, the lids will not stay shut tight -- the lids are all a tad too large. They almost fit and tend to slip up and away from the bowl rim which permits air to enter. That in itself is not such a huge problem because the bowls themselves can be sealed with Saran Wrap or other plastic wrap product then covered with the tight-fitting lid. Overall, I am very pleased with this product but give it only a 4-star rating because of the lid issue.\", 'Title: These seem really nice; Content: Nice looking set of bowls. So far, the lids fit well (need to kind of \"burp\" them as you put them on so they will stay in place). Decided to hand wash these instead of using the dishwasher, because previous experience with bowls that have non-slip/silicone bottoms shows that eventually the bottoms will become very \"sticky\" and loosen from the metal. (Suspect it\\'s a combination of the heat and the strength of dishwasher soap.) So, a little annoying to have to hand wasy, but will be worth it if they last.', 'Title: Useful bowls, lids not so much; Content: Great bowls. Love the nonslip bottoms, and that the taller profile lets me store more in less shelf space. I especially like the 8 qt bowl for making huge salads including beans, grains, and chopped veggies to eat all week. My only complaint is that the kids DO NOT SEAL, even following the directions.', \"Title: Nice bowls; Content: These are some nice bowls. The lids fit nicely inside the bowl instead of going over the edges like most covers do. The rubber bottom keeps them from slipping on the table. They are easy to clean but I noticed that when I used my electric mixer on one it left some marks. I can still use the bowl I just don't like the marks. So as long as I use wooden or plastic spoons they will stay nice for a very long time.\", \"Title: Great bowls but the lids warp.; Content: The bowls are wonderful with the no-slip bottoms and being easy to clean. The bowls can go in the dishwasher, but the lids need to be washed by hand. My only complaint is that the lids warp. We've barely had the bowls six weeks and the lids are already warping. Laying the lid on the counter with something heavy on it like a water bottle seems to have helped, but I dont want to have to leave lids all over the counter every time we use the bowls.\", 'Title: Good bowls, but loose tops; Content: Bowls are great in size and stackability, the rubber bottom helps it grip the surface it is on, the only drawback is that some of the lids are not tight sealed and can pop off or become loose, so you have to place another item on the top to keep it down. But I have used and cleaned all the bowls and lids and they are great especially since i got my Smoker grill and have a lot of leftovers and or need to season or add sauce!!', \"Title: Great mixing bowls; Content: Easy to clean and love all the different sizes. However, the lids don't fit that well. I've only had to use the lids on them once, and they don't fit tight like they should.

They are a staple in my kitchen\", 'Title: Nice Section of Bowls and Lids.; Content: I love all of the different sizes and lids. The silicone on the bottom is great for making them not slide around. My only issue is how light they are. I bought one large bowl years ago and it is much heavier and sturdier. Even so I love these bowls.', 'Title: Good bowls, lids not so much; Content: Great bowl, smooth surface stainless steel, the rubber gripper on the bottom is nice. The lids are tricky, just don\\'t want to easily slide into place and stay there. Took some figuring out, but still I wouldn\\'t trust the lid to stay on if the bowl were full and tipped over. The lid doesn\\'t actually \"snap\" into place.', \"Title: Good for value; Content: I liked how it stacks but the lids seem a bit weak or flimsy. It's hard to explain. I noticed that the lids were kinda warped already out of the box. I know the lids are not dishwasher safe so I hand washed them before storing them. I like how there are little markers inside the bowl for liquid qrts. The rubber bottom is helpful to keep things quiet in the kitchen. Ive used a couple of bowls for making cookies and it worked just like a normal mixing bowl would. Overall it's good for its value but nothing special.\", \"Title: Rubber-like bottom not a good feature; Content: I thought I'd appreciate the bottom of the bowl being rubber-like, but in practice, the rubber-like bottom prevents smoothly moving the bowls around the countertop. Good idea in theory, but not so good in the kitchen.\", 'Title: They are good looking; Content: These are nice quality bowls. Like that it has grips on the bottom of each bowls. Not sure yet about the insides if they will eventually get scratches sooner or later. The lids ,I thought, are not as tight , because I use the biggest bowl for salads. The measurements inside the bowls are awesome. Over all they are good.', 'Title: Nice, but lids do not stay on; Content: I like this product a lot. I have had it now for about 2 months, and I am extremely happy with the number of sizes that come with, the way they are able to sit in each other, and the sturdy material. The only problem that I have is that the lids do not work. You would think that they would fit in and stay in place, but they do not seal. They keep coming loose and coming off. I have to stack multiple heavy things on top of the lids to keep them on and sealed. In all, this is great for mixing things together, but not good for possible food storage.', 'Title: Good Bowls, Poor Lids (initially); Content: Nice bowls, good range of sizes. The larger lids were warped so that they did not seal no matter that I pushed in the middle to make a vacuum. After storing all of the lids, nested, under all of the bowls, also nested, the lids flattened out enough that they all worked fine after a couple months.', 'Title: Great bowls, difficult lids; Content: I love the range in sizes of these bowls as the largest size is perfect for larger recipes. My only complaint is that the lids are difficult to close, and get even more tough after the bowl is in the fridge.', 'Title: Good value; Content: These are really great bowls especially for the price! A little trouble closing and sealing the lids though. You have to get a knack for it and then it gets a little easier. Good value!', \"Title: Great Bowls; Content: I really like these bowls with their non skid bottoms. You don't have to worry about the bowl sliding on your counters. The only issue we have is that the lids are a little hard to put on at times. Other than that, I love the product.\", \"Title: Good value and rubber base makes life quieter; Content: I like steel bowls but they are a bit noisy so the rubber base means these don't bang around as much and also don't slip around the surface. Quality seems good and washing has been fine. Good value for a set of 5. n.b. I'm on a mission to write genuine reviews (too many fake ones). I genuinely purchased this item with my own money without incentive or connection to the seller/manufacturer. If you find my review useful, please click 'helpful' so I know, thanks.\", 'Title: This stainless steel mixing bowls set is really good for making cakes.; Content: This stainless steel mixing bowls set is really good for making cakes. The 8 QT one was for beating egg white. The 5QT one was for whisking flour and baking powder and salt. The 3QT one was for creaming the butter and sugar together. The 1.7QT one is for preparing the frosting. The 1OT one was for orange juice. The 0.75QT one was for carrying the egg yolks. It makes cakes easier. Also, the stackable function is a plus that help me save a lot of storage space. I also like the nonslip silicone bottom coting that prevent slipping when beating or mixing.', 'Title: These are great bowls. They are larger than most sets which ...; Content: These are great bowls. They are larger than most sets which makes them versatile for mixing and storing for larger gatherings. I love the non slip bottoms.', 'Title: Solid product!; Content: Was very happy with the performance of these mixing bowls. Light weight yet durable and wash up beautifully.', 'Title: Great deal on mixing bowls! Very Nice; Content: Great bowls for the money. As described - and worth it!', \"Title: LIDS WORK GREAT!; Content: Please disregard the reviews where customers complain about the lids, they ARE air tight. You have to press them closed starting at one end and rocking the seal to the other end; you are pressing out enough of the air inside in order to have the lid close properly. Lifting the front of the lid, while pressing the back and sides allows the air to escape from the front and gives you a perfect seal. If it doesn't seal, you have too much air inside the container; try again. If you don't release the pressure the trapped air inside will cause ALL the problems people listed in their complaints. If you follow the above directions then you will be thrilled with your purchase. Hope this help. VERY GOOD product!!!\", \"Title: Very pleased, lids fit fine; Content: I read reviews complaining about the lids, but bought anyway as most of the time I won't need a lid. However, following the seller's instructions to push down in the middle (you have to push some air out for them to seal, just like Tupperware) the lids all fit and sealed. Love the non-slip silicone rubber base, my old bowls would leave gray marks from sliding on the kitchen counter. The stainless steel part is a good weight, and I like the size of the rim. They are very shiny, mirror-like, and I see complaints that after use that goes away. That's normal, and not something I care about.\", \"Title: The perfect set of mixing bowls, really!; Content: This is a really well designed set. It has a smart range of sizes and the largest size, which feels huge, still fits neatly in my cabinet. They have measurements etched onto the interior, and the silicone bottoms prevent the bowls from sliding around on the counter without adding any excess weight. The rims are rolled so pouring is easy and mess-free, but they still stick out just enough to get a comfortable grip. Contrary to some reviews, the lids DO fit perfectly, you just have to glance at the directions. You place the lid on the bowl, then press down firmly in the middle to lock the lid in place by pressing some air out. The suction from the vacuum is what keeps the seal tight. If that sounds unstable, it's not. I've used these to marinate food in and you can turn them completely upside down and that lid isn't going anywhere. I don't understand the complaints about the inside of the bowls getting scratched, I mean, they're mixing bowls not art pieces? The bowls do great in the dishwasher, but of course you should hand wash the lids. Like anything made of flexible plastic, they could warp with the heat. A very good buy, highly recommended.\", \"Title: Great quality!; Content: These are perfect! I needed to replace my 15yr old mixing bowl and decided to get this set because of the silicone bottom. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Very good quality. The measurements on the inside are a huge bonus. I keep forgetting it's there lol. Haven't used the kids yet so can't comment on that but the bowls are beautiful. Used my hand mixer and didn't have any scratches. I'm anticipating a long life for these babies!\", \"Title: Good mixing bowl set; Content: Due to the reviews, I almost didn't get the lids, but I'm glad I did. One person's review said to press down like tupperware to get all the ari out. Yes, that worked (sometimes gotta keep pressing but it works)\", \"Title: Harder to break than Pyrex; Content: I had a 4 qt Pyrex bowl that lasted for about 2 weeks. It was in the sink and it barely tapped the side and a giant sliver split off making the lip of the bowl dangerously sharp. This product doesn't suffer from that malady. I've mainly only used to the large bowl for mixing and meal prep. The lid fits snug (useful for bread and dough making). The rubberized bottom keeps the bowl from sliding around the counter when kneading in the bowl. Definitely more happy with this set of bowls than I was with the Pyrex bowls.\", 'Title: Great Bowls; Content: Excellent set of mixing bowls. We had some IKEA stainless bowls and grew to hate them. The base was so small they would tilt easily and no tops. Found these and we are very happy with the functionality. Features we like the most: the large base to prevent tilting, the lids are excellent for putting things on top in the fridge, measuring markers on the side, they nest inside each other easily. Noticed some slight discoloring on the black rubber bottom from soap/hard water. Thats my only dislike.', 'Title: Good quality for the price.; Content: Yes, I’d buy these again. These bowls was perfect, as I got them for a Christmas gift.', 'Title: Perfect; Content: We are a clumsy septuagenarian couple. Recently, two ceramic serving bowls fell out of the cupboard and shattered. A couple of days later our large glass mixing bowl exhibited some chips. This set of mixing bowls is great. My wife says we should have bought them 40 years ago. The are lighter than the ceramic ones that broke. The covers are on the verge of being too tight. I think it would take deliberate work with a hammer to dent them.', \"Title: Good mixing bowls; Content: These are sturdy. I am very happy with the quality. The measurements on the inside of the bowls is clear on all of them. The lids creat a tight seal. I plan to put the bowels in the dishwasher but not the lids. I've already washed one and used it. They arrived 2 hours before I wrote this. Lol. I'm happy with them.\", 'Title: So Cute but just one problem; Content: I am SO excited to transform the kitchen with these. They are smaller than I expected but still great. However, two of my lids came totally broken and missing one wing to keep them closed :(', 'Title: Lids not dishwasher safe and hard to see pen; Content: These are smaller than I expected. The lids are not dishwasher safe, which is only stated on the box it’s packaged in. That was frustrating, as by the wording on here you would think it’s saying the lids are only not allowed in the microwave. The chalk pen they send along is blue, which is hard to see on the black chalkboard sticker. White would be much better. Overall they are good, but would have been nice to know about the lids prior to the purchase.', 'Title: Kinda a pain; Content: Kinda a pain to snap all four sides down . My hubby never takes the time to so it defeats the purpose . Lol. I’d buy a one snap lid instead and be done with it 👍🏼', \"Title: Missing a lid.; Content: I was really excited to receive these then when I opened the package I was missing one lid then amazon was not making it easy to fix this for me. I set a request for this lid replacement weeks ago and still haven't heard back. I really love this set but I am extremely disappointed I can't use the whole set.\", 'Title: Okay; Content: Basically tuppaware with snap lids. Looks different from the photos.', 'Title: Need to buy replacement lids for two lids with broken tabs.; Content: Each lid has 4 snap tabs (one on each side) to lock an airtight seal. Be very careful when attaching the lids. I broke one snap tab on two different lids on the first day I used these containers. Now I have 2 containers without an airtight seal. I contacted the seller about this, but unfortunately they do not have any extra lids to give or sell me. They offered me an apology and a $2 refund which I accepted, but have still not received. I would rather have the option to purchase new lids to replace the broken lids. I suggested to the seller/manufacturer that they should sell \"lids only as a set of four\". These lids are all the same size (interchangeable) for all the different sizes of containers and it is just a matter of time before another lid breaks or gets lost. I do not want to throw away containers, just because I have broken lids. I also do not want to have to buy new containers if all I need are lids. If I could buy extra lids, I might even buy more sets of these containers. If not for the problem with broken lids and the added problem of not being able to purchase replacement lids, this is a good product. Other than the tabs on the lids, these containers feel durable and provide an airtight seal for food storage.', \"Title: The lids don't work in some containers; Content: This containers are okay, but they are not sheer and some lids don't work or are really hard to open, I think they were to expensive for what it is.\", 'Title: Heavy duty!; Content: Love the air tight/water tight feature of the lids. Also ALL lids are the same size so you never have to hunt for one that fits! Love it. Also various sizes work great for various products. While a bit pricey I believe they are a good value. Would buy again and would recommend!', 'Title: Good buy; Content: These are nice and feel of good quality. All pieces were delivered as advertised and lids fit snug. Your cabinets will thank you. Made in China.', 'Title: Nice; Content: Ordered these to use in our travel trailer. Quality is great, love the lids and the accessories are nice and small for RV living. I gave 4 stars because I originally ordered the khaki but the lids and accessories were different shades and I wasn’t a fan of the color of the lids. Probably not a big deal to most people but I exchanged them for the black set.', \"Title: Bowls; Content: The only problem I have with these mixing bowls is that I thought they came with graters. The ones I received didn't have graters. They just have regular lids.\", \"Title: Surprisingly decent for the price; Content: These are actually quite a bit better than I would have expected for the price. I like the non slip bases, I like the etched measurements on the inner surface. Lids seem to stay in place pretty well, so all but the largest one should be pretty airtight. That one won't do as well in that regard since the smaller removable part for the graters doesn't sit as tight and doesn't secure it from any airflow as well as the outer edge alone would. The graters work OK, not sure I'd ever really use them here since it's just a bit awkward, and the rest of the tools that were bundled with it are pretty junk quality, I assume added simply so they could add to the number of pieces in the description without impacting the price much. Ignore the rest of the stuff, focus on the bowls, and for the price they're pretty nice.\", 'Title: Wow! That sums it up.; Content: All I NEEEDED was a disc for a grating bowl but after seeing this thought for the price, now was time to update my \"inherited\" ancient Vollrath (made down the street!!) Bowls that had to be at least 60 years or more but never had lids. These are EASILY of as good of quality. They are also VERY attractive looking and the inner/outer markings are etched nice and clear. This metal has a SUPER SMOOTH silky feel to it on the interior and just a hair of brushing in the outside to give a nice grip.The utensils included are nice material, WAY better than I was expecting and will make great backups and multitasking easier.', 'Title: Ignore the other review; Content: Ignore the other review saying these are okay. Because these are excellent. For $29 you get not only mixing bowls but lids and utensils and some extras. The utensils it came with are amazing quality silicone. I love these. The colors match my utensils I bought myself. Love love love.', 'Title: Great Bowls; Content: These bowls are great! I was worried that they would be thin and flimsy because of the price but they’re very sturdy. The lids are airtight. The rubber on the bottom keeps them from moving around. They are very nice looking as well. I would highly recommend them.', \"Title: Great bowls for the Kitchen; Content: I used this product fir when I have different batter to mix when I'm making cake, also for different salads, like garden and pasta. I feel comfortable using these bowl sespecially where there is support at the bottom of the bowl.\", 'Title: Pleasantly surprised; Content: I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. They are heavier than I anticipated and has color coded bottoms to coincide with colored lids.', 'Title: Love how they fit together and come with lids; Content: Love how they fit together and come with lids', \"Title: So Useful With So Many Uses; Content: I have to say, I am so happy with this set of high-quality, heavy-gauge stainless steel bowls. These are very well made in my opinion. Very nicely polished and shiny, no scratches or dents when arrived. The matching colors non-skid silicone bottoms and lids are also a very nice touch. Although one or two of the lids are a little warped, it wasn't that big a deal. Just followed the description on the product page to push down the middle of the lid to air out creating a vacuum inside and then press with both hands on the edges repeatedly to create a super tight lid for the bowls. Not quite sure if the lids are made of hardened silicone or plastic but just to be safe do not microwave the lids or dish wash them, only hand wash to prevent warping or deform. Similarly, with the three graters included, hand washes only. The silicone spatula set and measuring spoons are bonuses to me considering the six beautifully made durable stainless steel bowls with lids are well worth the price by themselves. Needless to say, I am very impressed with this whole set, very well made and so useful for me.\", \"Title: Very happy!; Content: I really like this kit! The bowls sizes are great and very useful for a bunch of situations where the size of the portions matter, I often times find a particular bowl too big for a personal salad for example, not anymore, I can just go and select the right size for the right portion and avoid wasting food preparing the right amount. The bottom of the bowls have a silicone base that adds grip to the surface of tables or countertops and prevents the bowls from sliding, I really like that, let's just hope the silicone don't gets off. The added items are a plus and I really appreciate they're included, the set of silicone spatulas are great and I see myself using them a lot, the egg yolk separator, the measuring cups and the whisk are essential for when preparing dough for baking, plus the 3 accessories for grating make this kit very versatile for almost any task from salad preps to baking or for mixing or even for storing food very safe because the stainless steel finish, I'm very happy with this product.\", 'Title: Great and versatile; Content: These mixing bowls are great for anybody who enjoys cooking. They come in a variety of sizes, for a variety of uses. The biggest bowl even has an opening at the top for different size graters so you can easily great cheese and have a good cock right in the bowl. They easily fill air tight, to keep food fresh. They are easy to clean, the stainless steel is shiny and the bottom is even color coded with the lid so you always know exactly which one to grab. Have a nice bonus, it came with a few kitchen utensils that you can use to help you cook. All in all the great value for an at home chef.', 'Title: Awesome bowls!; Content: The bowls are awesome! The set comes with 6 bowls and lids. I love that the bottom is made of rubber to prevent slippage. The bottoms are color coordinated with the tops. The larger bowl lid has an opening for the two graters. There is a coarse grater and a thinner one. Both pop into the lid with ease. When not using the grater, there is a plastic stopper that closes off the opening. It comes with measuring cups but they are so cheaply made that I likely won’t use them. It also comes with a set of mini utensils—frosting spatula, marinating brush, and a few others. Overall, a great set.', 'Title: an amazing set of bowls that co!rd with lids.; Content: This amazing set of bowls makes life easier and storing salads easier.If you make dishes for family gets this makes carrying potato salad or other such dishes so easy.I love them they make storing left overs so easy.The price is so affordable and they make a great gift idea.House warming or wedding gift etc.', 'Title: Just what I needed all the right sizes and Handy; Content: Love the base, love the collection. lids fit well.

They could have been returned broken... and there were no more available to purchase so that I could send them back.\", \"Title: OK, not ideal; Content: Sturdy and streamlined but lids are not easy to put on or take off. Wish they had a pour spot then they lids wouldn't have to come off.\", 'Title: Could be better but they work🤷🏾\\u200d♀️; Content: The only problem I have with this product is that the lids don’t stay snapped down.

After washing them in soapy water, they still smell. The bowl itself is functionally a bowl, but the lids do not fit. If you want to pay $30 for a set of 3 very thin, stainless steel mixing bowls without lid functionality, by all means.. These are not worth $10 in my opinion.', 'Title: \"Airtight Lids\" do not work on any of the bowls!!!; Content: The bowls are great! I love the different sizes, color and the fact that they are non-slip resistant. I really dislike the fact that the lids don\\'t seal properly and are bent after a couple of uses. None of the lids close anymore and I really wish I could find other lids as I really love my containers and hate storing my food in the fridge without a lid.', 'Title: Don’t buy; Content: None of the lids stay on or fit properly.

An absolute joke.', \"Title: 3 uses and one bowl has holes in the metal side....; Content: I loved these bowls, love that they have lids and are color coded.

They wouldn't mail me the three lids; I would have to return the whole box, which I had already thrown out.

They look really nice and I love how easily they nest in the cabinet.

I hope the corners are not cracked the next time I order.', 'Title: Bowls are great!; Content: Just as described and I have not had any of the issues with the lids that some reviewers have reported.

One star removed for this but not worth returning the whole set over.', 'Title: Redesign the tops; Content: I wish the tops were designed differently. They fit. But the plastic is too plasticy and needs more rubber or silicone to make the flexible and easy to close. The bowls are great. the tops not so much I fear I may get 3 or so uses from the tops.', \"Title: Great value; Content: I think they're great bowls. Yes they do show scrape marks, especially if you use a blender for potatoes or something. I've seen a lot of reviews were people had problems with the lids, but I have not experienced that. The lids are very tight and they stay that way until I open them.\", 'Title: Worth the Money; Content: These are very nice stacking bowls that clean up well. At first I had trouble closing the lids. One size popped up when the other went down. Oddly, after a few washes in the dishwasher, the suction worked perfectly. I like color coordination for easy lid/container identification.', 'Title: Functional for smaller spaces; Content: I’m very happy with these bowls. I would get again definitely worth it! One of the greatest thing about these bowls is they are each colored so u instantly know what kid goes to what bowl.', 'Title: Only issue is with the lids.; Content: It is great that the bowls nest within one another, however; I feel an opportunity was missed with the lids.

Thanks seller for a great product at a great price.', \"Title: Perfect set!; Content: The silicone bottoms on these are great for working on slippery countertops. And the lids actually fit! The metal of the bowels is also reasonably thick - I'm never worried about dents or deforming if I use my hand-held mixer with them.

These are a GREAT value for the price.\", \"Title: Love These Bowls!!!!; Content: These are perfect. Every size I might need, non-slip bottom, color coded to sealing lid for each - and they nest on my shelf, taking up only as much space as the largest bowl. Awesome product. I use them every single day and can store leftovers in the frige by slapping a lid on it. Great for taking to potlucks and parties, too, as the lids are easy to find and hard to forget and leave behind. All my friends who see one want one. mm -mm.

I love the grip on the bottom so they don't slide while I'm mixing.\", \"Title: Love!; Content: These bowls are great! They seem like good quality and I love the fact that the color of the matching lid is on bottom of the bowls. If you are like me, you have a pile of lids and hope the first one that you pull out is a match. With these it's not a struggle to find the matching lid. I also like that it's silicone on the bottom that holds the bowl in place. I would highly recommend this set.\", \"Title: Needed this!; Content: Needed some light weight mixing bowl I could also keep overnight in the fridge. Perfect. Still use my pyrex bowls for microwave, but use these 90% of the time. Tops are a little loose, so don't try to toss something in olive oil. But, bowls are great for the classic chef toss technique... nothing flies out of the bowl.\", 'Title: Great bowls and lids!; Content: I love these bowls! The color coded lids are a great idea. I like the non- slip bottoms. I noted some comments about the lids being a problem, but I have not had a problem. Just put the lid on top of the bowl and press down in the center of the lid. It stays fine and comes off easily. I highly recommend these bowls.', \"Title: Great set of bowls; Content: I'm at the stage of my life where a set of bowls makes me happy.

I loved them so much I ordered a 2nd set. The second set came disformed I'm unable to use. The container are weirdly shaped and the lids do not fit on them.

The Pros: Price. It comes with a lot of accessories, such as measuring tools and a whisk. The bowls are sturdy. Air tight lid when in room temperature. The Cons: The accessories are cheap plastic and whisk is flimsy. The bowl is study because of the crease at the bottom and top side of the bowl. I would of like for it to be smooth all around. The lid are not tight when placed in a cold place like a refrigerator. The plastic lid is pliable plastic and contract when cold, so it would contract about1/4 of an inch so it render the lid loose. For the price it's not bad just not perfect, but fit my needs.\", \"Title: A little thin but good sizes; Content: Update: They are definitely thin and the interior fits scratch pretty easily. But three different sizes ase perfect and I use them daily. Would recommend it. I just received them. I like the outer brushed metal and inner shiny metal finish.

If I didn't already have stainless steel ones. I do wish these were stainless steel. I love the silicone spatulas that came with this. The wisk is smaller than usual full size, but not bad. However, despite all of these, my main concern is that the bowls are kind of thin. Do they might end up denting easily. I wish that, instead of the add-ons, the bowls themselves were of thicker material. Only time will tell Joe they last.\", 'Title: Love the bowls, lids not so much; Content: I was in the market and for some prepping bowls as I cook a lot and these seemed like a great deal. The bowls themselves are sturdy and I have no issues with them. The lids, however, suck. They are not airtight and if you use them in the fridge, they contract more. Some of them (mainly the largest lid) are not even level and there is no way to flatten it out so it is unusable. The additional tools that came with them are also surprisingly good quality. I didnt need more but I make good use of the measuring spoons and cups and even the brush.', 'Title: Great bowls, but don’t count on the lids; Content: Great assortment of sizes for prep work, but calling the lids “airtight” is a huge stretch. Sitting still they cover fine but any jarring will knock it loose. I was initially disappointed in the size assortment since I was hoping for a couple of bowls on the larger end....you should notice the sizes between the largest and second-largest have quite a gap. However, after getting them, I’ve found the sizes to be absolutely perfect for meal prep. I didn’t know I was needing some of these, to be honest. Super easy to clean, measuring cup/spoon set is nice enough. Other tools in the set are rather small but ok.', 'Title: Great value; Content: Great value for the price- the bowls are useful as well ad the accessories. The lids are a little difficult to get in but if you press down in the center and then seal the edges it holds. Other than that, everything was exactly as expected which is all that I can ask! Worth the purchase.', \"Title: Stainless Steel Bowls inquiry...; Content: The Stainless Steel Bowl set is great. LOVE the snap on plastic lids!

I love how the kids pop in. They are nice and deep so you can mix in them without it coming out of the bowl. All the other things was a bonus. Also it helps food stay hot or cold longer.', 'Title: Strange picture, but overall great set!; Content: I ordered this mixing bowl set for the bowls alone and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that each bowl came with a lid AND the sellers throw in a set of measuring spoons AND other assorted mixing utensils. I was about to buy a new set of measuring spoons but didn’t need them anymore because this came with a decent quality set.

The lids fit really well and are honestly leak proof. There are measurements printed on the inside, which I love. The bowls come with a bunch of little plastic kitchen tools that are really unnecessarily, as these mixing bowls and lids are a great value priced around $25.. No hesitation in recommending these mixing bowls.', 'Title: Not airtight!; Content: Should have just paid more for the name brand ones... these won’t keep your food fresh. The plastic lid has rough parts from poor injection molding and the rubber seal wasn’t effective on any of the canisters', 'Title: These are not air tight; Content: The kids do not stay in place there is no lock to them. As soon as you grab the lid it pops off.', 'Title: Very attractive but cant recommend; Content: This review is lengthy and I apologize. PROs: The containers are very attractive and fit well in the hand at 3 ½ inches wide. The tallest of the containers is only useful (my experience) for pasta or other products with low weight as a heavier item (rice for instance) makes the container top heavy when filled. The lid is easy to lock into place and it does seal items in the container. CONs: There are many different manufacturers on Amazon offering containers like this product as this container style is very popular. However, not all products are dishwasher safe. The manufacturer of this product indicates it is dishwasher safe but does not recommend placing the lids in the dishwasher. The product vendor recommends not placing the lids in water to clean. Instead they recommend wiping the lids with a cloth. The reason for this is that the lid is made of two halves connected by a metal spring inside. The two halves separates slightly when the lid is in the unlocked position. The advertising states they are air tight, which they are when closed. However, liquids or materials that are fine such as flour can enter the lid from the top where the locking mechanism is at. Or, at the separation of the two halves when unlocked. If food particles get inside the lid it is (my experience) near impossible to clean out and it requires a blow dryer to dry out thoroughly if water/liquids gets inside. You can see from pictures that the lids seem to close unevenly and that food such as flour, sugar, bread crumbs, etc cling to the sides of the containers and the lids increasing the chance that food particles will get inside the lid which I believe could cause mold if not cleaned well. I have containers from two different manufacturer and I like the look and feel but I will not repurchase any container with this lid type. There are similar containers that have different lid types. I recommend getting a container with solid lids that use a screw connection, press on fit or use some sort of clamp with silicone/rubber seals that can be easily cleaned. Make sure you can wash in a dishwasher. Unfortunately, getting containers with a better lid appears to increase the price by $5 to $10+.', \"Title: I've bought 4 sets of these so far.; Content: the best style out THERE, but shop it for price...... alot of sellers SELL THIS same product and this style is the best design out there. price is all over the place and will vary by 10 or 20 dollars for the identical thing so look around. and they are ALL THE SAME. so shop for price.. if you drop it they will break.....COUNT ON IT.... the covers with the snap on four sided lids don't work, so don't waste your money on that style... the seams on the lids tear off in a few days.....\", \"Title: Great buy! I bought 2 sets!; Content: Pretty decent product, for the cost. Works, and stacks, exactly as pictured. Just received them a few days ago, all intact and in proper working order. Once I unboxed, there were no instructions as far as use, care, or anything else. They're not like the OXO type cannister lids where you can disassemble to clean. I just washed it all with lukewarm, soapy water. I towel-dried the receptacles. Whilst in the open position, I pried slightly apart what I can to have the fluid sloshing inside the lid to get out, and then air dried the lids for over 24 hours as there is a gap in between the seals. A good tip provided me (a bit too late) is just to wipe the lids with towel. The seal all in all is pretty decent also. Lift the tab and over and you get the seal. The silicone washer of sorts - airtight seals the cannister. It looks like there's a spring of sorts in between that's attached to the grey lever outside. Prolly wasn't a good idea to wash it lol coz rust? I'm hoping it's fine in the long run. I purchased two sets of these, coz aethetics for my small apartment pantry. I like the labels and marker it came with. Although, I wonder if the same labels are chalk friendly so I can re write whatever the next use could be for the cannister. All in all, a great buy, compared to other 7 piece set cannisters (most are $30-70!). Wish there were bigger and wider ones, just as cheap - to house 3lb bags of flour.\", 'Title: Pretty good; Content: From reading other reviews, I only wiped the lids with a soapy rag, no submersion into water.

While of course they don\\'t go in the microwave, I can get by with only one glass bowl for that type of task. What these bowls do have going for them is that they go in the dishwasher, and most of all, each lid is color-coded to match its bowl. The bowls nest and the lids stack under them--a big space, time, and frustration saver. They do well in the dishwasher; so far the shiny interior has not gotten etched, and the lip does not collect as much water as other bowls I\\'ve had. I\\'m very pleased with this purchase. 1/7/19 Update: as other reviewers stated, not all the lids fit the bowls perfectly. Some do, but one lid is large enough that I wouldn\\'t store the bowl with juicy food in it on its side or turn it over. Another lid is small enough to need some \"persuasion\" to go on.

Typically I don\\'t store food in bowls, only as prep or for storing something I\\'ve made in the bowl and know will be eaten w/in 24 hours; most of us have tight-sealing food storage containers for leftovers and longer storage.

The covers, on the other hand, were completely useless...; Content: We use these bowls for everything except storage. They are awesome for food prep and the silicone bottoms are a nice touch, both visually and to minimize clanging when storing and moving them around. The lids seem super cheap and useless, though. They stiffen when placed in the fridge, taking on a sort of \"potato chip\" shape, so that they no longer seal properly..', 'Title: Ease use; Content: Love these bowls. Easy to clean and use. I only should have bought something with a see through top or side (my fault) as it’s much easier to see in fridge.', 'Title: Good bowls, issues w color; Content: Like the bowls but first wash in the dishwasher they color has changed', 'Title: Love these. No more heavy lifting.; Content: These are awesome! I love the weight of them as well as the non-skid bottoms and matching lids. They have a nice rolled edge that is comfortable to handle. The lids are a bonus, and although some people have said that they have a problem putting on the lids, I haven’t had an issue. These are replacing some heavy crockery type mixing bowls that I was tired of lifting and and re-stacking every time I needed to use one. Plus, all of these bowls fit in the same space as the three I traded these for. I highly recommend them.', 'Title: Great bowls, good quality shiny stainless steel; Content: Great bowls, good quality shiny stainless steel, so colorful silicone bottoms and top covers, not so light as cheap ones, great to use for a fresh-made popcorn!', 'Title: Very nice; Content: I really like these bowls. I will also take them in the camper with us because the bottoms are non-slip.', \"Title: Great Stainless Bowl Set; Content: I am very happy with my bowl set. I got the colored ones just because they seemed fun, but I really, really wound up loving the silicone bottoms. It really adds to the stability of the bowl especially while using a hand or emersion mixer. I would totally buy this set again, but I have a feeling I won't need to replace these bowls for a very, very long time.\", \"Title: Great bowls lids are pretty useless!; Content: What a great set of bowls for the price!! Super impressive! Way better then I expected for the price! My 14 year old daughter has taken an interest in baking and we needed some mixing bowls. I love the measuring scale on the inside of the each bowl so you don't even need a measuring cup. Just fill it up to the line and call it good. Also cute colors. Sturdy material. Easy to wash. DISAPPOINTING EDIT: Unfortunately, I have to edit my review because the lids not only warp in the dishwasher but they never sealed right to begin with and are now basically useless.. such a BUMMER! Because I really like the bowls!\", \"Title: Buy these! Forget the rest!; Content: I searched long and hard for the PERFECT set of nesting mixing bowls. These are light, stack great, and the super BONUS they have their own COLOR COORDINATE airtight lids. And if you put water in them and seal the lid per instructions- you can even shake it all around with no leaks! Most coffee thermos' can't even handle that! The guide along the inside that tells amounts is also amazing!\", 'Title: High quality; Content: Bowls are impossible to move while doing the stirring. I love that! My bowls are not going to peel off any colors either and are easy to use in the dishwasher as well. I love the color coordinated lids. they are so pretty!', \"Title: Love this set!; Content: I am so happy with my purchase. They are so pretty, I love the no slip base, and that rhey come with a matching,durable lid. They have measurement markings on the inside of the bowl, which comes in handy with recipes.

The 5 sizes are perfect for my needs especially the largest one. I would recommend them.\", \"Title: These bowls are great; Content: Great quality. Love the rubberized bottom for no slipping and lids for a tight seal. Added bonus of measurement notations inside. I'll be getting a few sets for Christmas gifts.\", 'Title: High quality good for mixing; Content: Nice mixing bowl set! The best part I love is the bottom. Colorful rubber on the bottom makes it look cute,also when you doing any mixing the bowls stay good they won’t moving!

Mixing Bowls; Content: Great product. sturdy and easy to clean. multiple sizes with cover. was able to separate from those who want red beans, from black beans, and the salad in the Big bowl.', 'Title: Versatile, durable, cute!; Content: Bought these for my daughter’s small kitchen because they can double as mixing bowls and food storage, plus they are stackable to save space. Love the skid-resistant bottoms, that also make them a good ice bucket!', 'Title: Great buy; Content: Love these bowls. The sizes are great and they are convenient to store.', 'Title: Look nice; Content: I like them very much but there is one lid that does not fit. I even had my husband try to close it. I do like how they look and the ones that do work look great. I’m going to contact the company for a new lid. I just got them 5 days ago.', 'Title: Lids don\\'t work...and Amazon wants a \"restociking fee\"...for a product that will not be restocked.; Content: I bought this set and put them in the cupboard. Only recently, almost a year after purchase, I needed the bowls but found that the lids do not work. They fit loosely and have warped. When I try to hold them in place, on a bowl, they just pop up once I remove my hands. These are now useless for the purpose advertised. Amazon wants me to return them for a refund minus a \"restocking fee\" that is subsantial...and this just does not make sense...because a \"restocking fee\" means that the item will be restocked and these will not be. No one will be buying my resturned item therefore it will not be \"restocked.\" Amazon also now has a horrible, time and work wasting AI chat thing that needs to be put in the trash and prevents me from communicating with the vendor, which used to be offered. Amazon is not acting responsibly when they allow these vendors to sell such junk and won\\'t allow a refund for fraudulently advertised items.', 'Title: NOT dishwasher safe; Content: I really liked them at first, but after being washed in the dishwasher, the lids are warped so that they no long seal on the bowls. This is disappointing because I specifically bought these because they had lids.', 'Title: Lids are not air tight; Content: Lids were warped and do not fit well. Not air tight. 1 bowl was dented.', 'Title: the lids did not fit....they were warped when I got then; Content: Sorry item...cheap! lids were warped when I got them', 'Title: Better quality control; Content: One lid had a piece missing.

Lids seem flimsy. Product box torn apart in shipping. Outside box OK,; Content: Purchased to give as a bridal shower gift. Had some difficulty trying to return it, and was running out of time, so will give the bowl set out of the product box. Amazon told me to call them if the bride wants to return this set.', 'Title: Crappy lids, excellent bowls.; Content: Very nice to look at. Sturdy and very functional. For the price, you can’t beat these! I love the silicone bases, they keep the bowls in place and add a nice look to them. As other reviewers have mentioned.. don’t buy these for the included lids. I tried about a million ways to put them on thinking there would be a trick to getting them to stay, but there isn’t. Even if they stay for a few minutes and you think you’ve cracked the code, you open your fridge to a bowed and displaced lid once again and have to resort to tin foil anyways. So I’ve given up on the lids, but overall extremely satisfied with these bowls as I bought them for mixing and not storing.', 'Title: Lids are Impossible!!!; Content: I would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn’t for the fact that the lids are impossible to put on. I literally have to put the bowl on the floor, place the lid on top and then kneel on it for it to lock into place. I’m thinking this just may be a kitchen hazard.', \"Title: Like'em!; Content: I like the fact that I finally have Stainless steel mixing bowls. I have been wanting them for a while and looked around for them at a lot of places and finally decided to buy them of Amazon because of the price. They are nice and big and store nicely (nesting bowls) in the pantry/kitchen cabinets. But they are not stainless. You really have to clean them nicely for them to not leave any mark/stain. Also I am not sure about the lids. They seem flimsy but I still have to use them enough to comment on the same.\", \"Title: They'll do!; Content: This product is good. The stainless steel actually does stain a bit, but it doesn't make them unusable. The lids don't fit properly, so I have to cover with parchment or waxed paper before the lid. The rubber bottoms make them kind of awkward in that I have to hold onto the bowl while mixing. Overall, they're okay, worth the price paid.\", 'Title: valuable; Content: When the lids are sitting in the fridge for several hours they get loose, but other than that is a prefect item to have at home.', \"Title: Love!; Content: I love that it has the silicone on the bottom at all of the mixing bowls have lids the only thing was the first time I wash them and I wash them by hand they worked a little bit I have not used them yet so I don't know if they're going to still properly but I will let you know further\", 'Title: Awesome!; Content: Only reason I gave 4 stars was because these bowls scratch so darn easily. Aside from that they are sturdy, slip resistant and easy to clean.', 'Title: Not to bad for the price; Content: Great bowls my only dislike is the covers dont stay on very well.', 'Title: Great bowls not-so-great lids; Content: The bowls are very nice. Good variety of sizes. However the lids do not stay on.', 'Title: Only problem; Content: The lids do not seem to work that well', \"Title: Poorly fitting lids; Content: I love the rubber bottoms, the nesting of the bowls for storage and easy cleanup. The lids don't fit very well after 1 wash and start to separate from the bowl. Other than that, they're excellent bowls.\", 'Title: My wife loves them; Content: They arrived two days after ordering, well packaged and exactly as described by seller. They have a nice weight, the lids fit tightly, and they are no-skid on the bottom.', 'Title: Good purchase; Content: The bowls grip counter well. Lids fit well. Easy to clean. A little heavier than expected but definitely lighter than glass bowls. They fit inside each other and closet well.', 'Title: I love these for our RV!; Content: These bowls are great quality and are perfect for our RV. I am able to use them going down the road with the nonslip bottoms. They clean up easy and the measurements in the bowls are an added plus.', 'Title: good products to cooking; Content: Anyone who cooks allot can appreciate these different size bowls, they are great for spices, washes, while preparing a meal, and nothing is more classic than stainless.', \"Title: Great product; Content: Everything from the lids and mixing bowls well designed, as well as the rubber padding at bottom so it doesn't move great. Oh and can't forget measuring engraved inside mixing bowls great idea.

The rubber grip on the bottom is awesome. No complaints', 'Title: great one; Content: those bowls for kid what is so safe，they are so lightweight that is what I want，the nonslip bottoms keep them secure when using，great to buy', 'Title: Cleaned out the cupboard!!!!; Content: Wish I had done this years ago.

Also the covers do not seal well. The pools themselves are sturdy and or everything I need. With the exception of sealing.', 'Title: Large lid doesn’t fit, surface rust after dishwasher; Content: I wanted to use the lids with the hole for my mixer while making bread in the largest bowl. It works for that purpose, however it doesn’t fit properly. So though it does contain the splashes of dough, I have to keep my hand on the lid to hold it on while using the mixer. That’s super annoying. The other 2 bowls have properly fitting lids. Also the plastic that the lids are made of feels sort of cheap. I’ve only used one grater for carrots and it seemed to work ok. The smallest bowl has a couple small spots of surface rust on the outside of the bowl after being washed in the dishwasher. I wanted super easy clean up so that part also really annoying. The bowls look cool with the matte brushed type finish on the outside and the shiny metal inside, and the measurements inside might be useful. I’d keep shopping for something better quality though.', 'Title: Lid No Longer Fits On Bowl; Content: Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Loved these bowls until I used them once and the lid no longer fits on the bowl. I hand washed the large bowl after use. I have no idea why it will no longer fit. The bowl has not been warped or damaged. If you do not plan on using the lid, the bowl itself is great. I could purchase these type of bowls for much cheaper without the lid and grater. I wanted to love these bowls!', 'Title: Nice bowls but lids don’t fit properly after a few times using; Content: Liked everything about these bowls but later found that the lids won’t stay on. I like the smaller hole in the center of the lid that holds the grater but didn’t like keeping or locating the exact one when needed. Too many pieces to the set.', 'Title: Lids don’t work; Content: These are great bowls with a great idea to add graters to the middle. Problem is kids will not stay on bowl. It’s a good mixing bowl but you must cover with foil as kids pop off and will not seal.', 'Title: Poorly made, and the inserts are useless!; Content: While these are attractive bowls, they’re just not made that well. The slicing/shredding inserts are so incredibly dull that they’re basically worthless. You could literally give them to a toddler to play with and have absolutely no worries about injury. After trying to shred carrots and slice cucumbers with these, and having no luck whatsoever, I finally tossed them in the trash can. I thought, “Well, at least the bowls are nice.” Less than a week later, I dropped one of the bowls on the floor and the handle just popped off. They’re not screwed on, just sort of glued, so into the trash went the handle. Finally, while the lids on the smaller two bowls fit well, the lid for the larger one refuses to go on and stay on. So for me, it’s back to looking for the perfect set of bowls. These sure aren’t it.', 'Title: Cooking bowls; Content: Pros: Nice Set Cons: Smaller bowl arrived with no attachment it’s like it was never connected to the bowl in the first placed', 'Title: The lids do not seal; Content: Nice bowls but the lids do not seal', \"Title: Not Exactly what I thought; Content: The bowls scratch easily on the inside and I didn't like the mirrored look. I don't know why I didn't return them. I do like the spout for pouring but, all the extras are just more clutter in my cabinet. I wished I just bought something more ordinary. I'll probably end up donating them.\", 'Title: Nice bowls; Content: Nice bowls, lids pop off without warning. The grater tools are alright but will stay in the drawer.', \"Title: Like the bowls but the handle fell off the largest one immediately; Content: These bowls were perfect for my needs, rubber non-skid bottoms, handles, volume markings on the inside, and the grater and slicer accessories were a bonus. However the lid on the large one does not fit well and likes to pop off, and also the handle came off the large one as soon as I used it. I can use it just fine without a handle so I didn't bother with sending it back at this point, but have yet to use the smaller ones so we'll see what happens with them.\", 'Title: Nice set with a bonus; Content: I like this set of bowls, and they come with lids which is a plus.. You can mix in them with the center of the lid removed which cuts down on splashing and there are grating attachments which just snap right in the center of the lid. How very clever ! I would recommend these and I like the non slip bottoms as well.', \"Title: Biggest lid doesn't fit; Content: The biggest lid doesn't fit. This is really irritating because a) grating things is tiring when the lid keeps trying to pop off and b) this means I can't use the biggest bowl to store things in the fridge. That said, everything else works great. The smaller lids fit their respective bowls. I grated some zucchini and some cheese, worked great.\", \"Title: Great Mixing Bowls; Content: Bowls are 5 stars. Yes. Everything else. They can keep. Lids done work. Will not stay on. Graters are dull. Don't work. Great bowls a little hard to stack, you have to have them line up just so. Would I buy them again? Why? Bowls like these should last a long time.\", 'Title: Stainless steel nesting bowls and attachments; Content: This are very useful kitchen bowls which make measuring and cooking and baking easier. The stainless steel is easy to clean, if you use a gentle cleanser, and keeps well and shiny in my storage unit. It stacks so other bowls can be put on it. A non-slip surface and silicone hands keep the bowls from slipping. Lids make storage in refrigerator better. These match my other equipment in style and they are very durable.', \"Title: Easy to use; Content: I just started to learn baking some cakes or cookies. These bowls can help me very well when I mixed all stuffs together, and it's also easy to clean no matter wash it by myself or washer machine. If you have bigger size, I will buy it again.\", \"Title: Nice set of mixing bowls; Content: I got these to replace heavy glass bowls. They are nice, don't slide on the countertop, and the handle and pour spout are nice features.\", 'Title: Best mixing bowls; Content: Heavy gauge metal but lightweight. Restaurant durability.', 'Title: Mixing bowls; Content: Very useful', 'Title: so well-made; Content: This far exceeded my expectations. It is sturdy, and well- designed. You can grate, cut etc and it goes right into the bowl and can then be used for storage, if desired. The bowl stays put on the counter as you prep food.', 'Title: Love these bowls; Content: I really enjoy using tjese bowls! Ive only used them a few times but withe holidays around the corner,that will change! They store riggt inside each other and the lids fit right on top👏👏', 'Title: Great mixing bowls; Content: Sturdy and perfect to use. The pour spout is handy, the graters that fit in the lids in incredibly helpful. I love this set', \"Title: Bowls are great. Lids aren't. They randomly pop off.; Content: I don't know what the deal is here - when this went through Vine in Feb they were pastel colored bowls with matching lids, and no graters and no holes in lids for them. I think my review is still pertinent, though, because they're using the same type lids, and that's my main focus. The lids don't work reliably. There's no latch or lip or catch, they're just push-in. Plastic on stainless isn't going to hold, and these don't. Sometimes as quickly as 2 mins, the lid will pop out, sometimes it slowly (relatively) slides out. We already had a really good set of bowls exactly like this, just without lids. Bowls like this are a dime a dozen these days. The ones we had were over 5 yrs old and same design, so it was the lids I was most interested in. Sadly, this makes them a 2 star for me. The steel is decently done, smooth and even and strong. The silicone on the bottoms are very effective non-skid. Just the lids aren't reliable.

Info here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_se_rspo_laas_aas\", 'Title: Lids are not dishwasher safe; Content: We have 2 sets of the bowls, the ones with the colors and another set what’s just black that had an extra, they are ultimately the same. First, quality. The bowls are decent, not high quality just decent. The lids are horribly cheap, I would not store food as they are not air tight seals. Second, cleaning. The bowls are dishwasher safe, however the lids are not. Don’t even try to put them in the top rack thinking that maybe they well be ok, they won’t. I tried it out of curiosity and they warp badly and won’t fit back on the bowl. Third, storage. The bowls are nested but not with the lids on them individually. Those just stack on top. The largest bowl measures at the widest point across the rim is 10” and 5.5” tall, so they will fit in the upper shallow kitchen cabinets. Add another 1-2 inches for the lids on top. Fourth, features. Silicone bottoms are good especially when the grand kids help in the kitchen. Bowls stay in place. The measuring lines on the inside of the bowls are in quarts and liters. Not heavily marked but visible closer up. I tested one bowl at the .5 and 1 quart lines, reasonably accurate, but still prefer to measure with other utensils. Last, price and usage. There was no price on these at the time I reviewed them but I have looking for a set of bowls for some time. My guess is under $40. The lids are just not practical to use for me. The bowls are decent and I can see us using them for when all the kids and grandkids are in the kitchen helping, so the quantity is good. I will likely set some of these aside solely for their craft projects and concoction. On a personal note, for everyday use, I would prefer a set of higher quality bowls and lids that are airtight.', 'Title: Really pretty!; Content: These are really pretty bowls and I like their style. We always need stainless bowls and these are good basic bowls, especially when we are doing a lot of baking. The sizes nest very well. The lids do not stay on. They pop up. I was pretty aggravated by that. My refrigerator sucks the life out of any uncovered item so I use plastic wrap with them.', \"Title: Stack Well, But Lids Warp; Content: When this arrived, everything was perfectly stacked in the 5-quart bowl. So handy! However, one trip through the dishwasher and the lids warped enough that nothing seals tight. There were no instructions saying if they were dishwasher safe. My guess is the lids aren't. That's too bad because I liked the bowels and the silicone bottom that keeps it in place on the counter.\", \"Title: Nesting bowls; Content: This is a nice set of nesting bowls that are stainless steel & include the colorful lids. They come in a box, however the one I received was pretty beat up, but luckily the bowls were not damaged. The lids could use some improvement though & its the reason why I rated these 4 and not 5 stars. The lids are flimsy, & don't seal up tight. The bowls get 5 stars. Lids - 1.5. I love that they fit inside each other so that makes it easier for storage & offer a variety of sizes.\", 'Title: Well made bowls, dishwasher safe but not leak proof from lids.; Content: Very well made bowls. The silicone on the bottom makes it easier to stir things in them without them slipping all over the counter. Color matching makes it easy to find matching lid. They all nest for storage. Ran through the dishwasher with no issues for either the bowls or the lids. Photo with soda can for scale. The lids are NOT watertight, I am deducting a star for this. If you invert the bowl with liquid in it, it will leak. Well made bowls, dishwasher safe but not leak proof from lids.', \"Title: Great Bowls, Not So Great Lids; Content: The mixing bowls are great. Nice sizes and easy to clean. However, the lids don't want to stay on. They don't have a secure fit so they pop out of place. I personally don't need to use the lids often, so this isn't really a problem for me. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this set if you need to use the lids.\", 'Title: Nice set - good color coding - lids not great; Content: Nice set - good color coding - lids not great as they are not the easiest to put on/off nor super secure once on. Not terrible but not great. I normally buy the well known brand name but needed a few extra bowls. I really enjoy the ability to store and keep secure but the lids were the weak spots with this set.', \"Title: Sturdy bowls with flimsy lids; Content: I like the colors on these, that it's easy to find the lid for any bowl at a glance. That's a nice feature (plus i can just tell my kid to get the yellow bowl or the purple bowl instead of arguing with them about which one is medium-sized). The bowls are sturdy, have approximate measure markings on the inside, and the rubberized bottom means they won't slide around your countertop while you're whisking. The lids, while useful, are a bit flimsy. I suggest hand-washing them instead of putting them in a dishwasher.\", \"Title: These really are great; Content: When I do my baking, i'm always using odds and ends to mix and store things. When I bake i'm always looking for the right sizes and usually have to mix in one and then move it all to another bowl for either storage or other ingredients because either they can't handle hear or the hand mixer. These are really great. The sizes are perfect! The lids fit great, no more trying to get plastic wrap or tin foil to stick to the old mixed matched bowls i have. One feature that really is the best is the bottoms of these have thick silicone that not only keep the bowls weighed down but also keep them from moving around while you are using them. Using a hand mixer with one hand has now become easy. I do't have to worry about the bowl flying around the counter. The stainless steel is also very heavy duty thick too. The quality of them overall is really top notch. I didn't expect them to be so well made. They all fit into each other which saves space and that's another plus. They are deep meaning they are designed to be taller and less wide so things don't splash and spill as easy. I like that the lids are color matched to the bottom silicone colors of the bowls. This helps so you aren't trying to find which lid fits the right bowl, you just match colors. They can go in the fridge or freezer. They say they are dishwasher safe but I don't put silicone in the dishwasher so I won't try these bowls either, i don't want to take a chance. Super happy with this set and really don't have anything to complain about which is rare...lol\", 'Title: High quality set with many great features.; Content: These are beautiful. I have a set like this from a well known brand and these are just as nice, but offer lids. The stainless is really high quality with a satin finish on the outside that helps hide fingerprints. The bottoms are all non-slip and curved so that you can put as much effort into your process as you desire. The lid fit very tightly and are very effective, even when held upside down. There are interior measurements as well. Very nice set in pastels.', 'Title: Amazing stainless steel mixing bowl set.; Content: These are by far my favorite mixing bowls. I love the beautiful colors on the bottom and the lids. The bowls have silicone on the bottom to keep them from slipping when mixing. The bowls are made from stainless steel. They have a good weight to them and are so easy to clean. The bowls are stackable and the lids can be placed under them to save space. The bowls have measurements on the inside. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this stainless steel mixing bowl set.', 'Title: Quality bowls, exceeded expectations; Content: This is a really great set of mixing bowls. The stainless steel is sturdy and durable and each bowl has a silicone coating on the bottom that helps keep it from shifting when in use. The lids are color coded to match its corresponding bowl and fit tightly. All of the bowls nest inside each other to save on storage space. These are so well made and practical and look great at the same time - they definitely exceeded my expectations.', 'Title: Made of thicker materials. Sturdy and beautiful; Content: I have no hesitation rating this 5 stars. They are made of thicker gauge stainless steel with silicone non-slip bases. They are beautiful and each size has a different color. The lids are a good fit. They even have measurements inside. Multi-purpose. They stack together for minimal storage space.', 'Title: Good quality and sturdy bowls. Non-slip base works well. Cheap lids.; Content: These are good sturdy bowls that feel like they will last for many years of use. Definitely more solid than the cheap supermarket bowl I had before. I really like the non-slip bases, especially on the smaller bowls which I would be more likely to accidentally knock over. The way the bowls nest together is great. I definitely wouldn\\'t have space in my kitchen to store them otherwise. The bowls also have a useful scale marked on the inside, and it\\'s etched into the steel, not painted or printed, so it won\\'t wear off. I found two negatives. One is the lids. As other reviewers have pointed out, they feel cheap, aren\\'t airtight and are not dishwasher safe. The design is poor, the lids are solid plastic with just a thin rib around the rim that\\'s meant to seal against the inside edge of the bowl. Plastic is too stiff for this. A rubber seal would be needed to make it airtight. The second is the FDA logo on the packaging. I won\\'t speculate as to why the manufacturer chose to put the logo there, but the use of the logo does not signify that the product is FDA certified in any way. In fact, this is misuse of the FDA logo. According to the FDA website: \"FDA’s logo is for official government use only. FDA’s logo should not be used to misrepresent the agency or to suggest that FDA endorses any private organization, product, or service.\" There\\'s nothing about dishwasher safety on the bowls or the packaging or in the product description, but never having had a problem with stainless steel, and seeing other reviewers report success, I took a chance. The bowls came out of the dishwasher just fine. However, having seen another reviewer mention the lids warped even on the top rack, so I didn\\'t try those. I did notice that when I dried the outside rim of the bowls, which collect some water when the bowls are upturned in the dishwasher, it left black stains on my kitchen towel. I wouldn\\'t expect a dishwasher to be able to clean under the rims, so it\\'s my fault for not washing them by hand the first time, but it would be nice if the manufacturer cleaned the rims before packaging.', \"Title: Finally, bowls that won't stain; Content: As much as I love my 20-years old plastic bowls, it was time for a change. I know that the most ideal mixing bowls are ceramic, but these stainless steel bowls are absolutely fantastic! It didn't matter to me if they have lids because how often do you need lids for mixing bowls? What I require of my bowls are that they won't get stained and that they are not flimsy. If the bowls are too light then they'll move around or even flip over while you're giving your mixing a good beating. Not only do they have some weight but there is the added bonus of that silicone bottom so it will stay in one place. Here's a really helpful part -- there are measurements on the inside of the bowls, too! These bowls are nice and weighty (but not too much!) and they hold the promise of no-staining from my many marinades with tomato or especially curry. This makes them easier to clean because I don't have to worry about scrubbing the yellow turmeric stains out of plastic and plus, plastic tends to fray (experienced cooks will understand this). There are no tiny pieces that will lift up in these bowls, that's for sure! Although the biggest bowl is pretty big, they fit inside one another for easy storage. Again, the lids just get in the way so I keep them underneath the bowls.\", \"Title: These storage bowls are as great as they are saying; Content: I already love these stainless steel bowls. They are much lighter than some of the Pyrex glass bowls I would use to store cut up foods I would make for dinner prep. I have been able to put some older, colorful Tupperware storage bowls in a donation bin as the plastic isn't as practical to use as stainless steel. The mixed colored tops and bottoms are fun and do their job of keeping the bowl steady and I haven't had a problem with the lids securing tightly. They are of course, Made in China, which seems to be something we can't always get away from. Price is great for what you get and they should last borderline forever. Have not used them for mixing wet/dry ingredients yet, but I can see they will be my go to bowls for that. Love them!\", \"Title: Nice set; Content: These bowls are made of reasonably heavy and sturdy stainless steel. The non-skid bottoms are great for working on slick stone countertops. They have measuring marks inside, which in theory seems very useful but in practice really isn't. In my experience, all measuring bowls stack for storage so I'm not really impressed with that. The smaller ones especially are getting a lot of use. The lids fit okay but are not airtight. I never had mixing bowls with lids before and they certainly are handy for storing something in the refrigerator for few hours, keeping flies out of food at a picnic, etc.\", \"Title: MY FAVORITE BOWLS!; Content: I don't think I have ever loved bowls like I love these bowls! I have constantly wished for mixing bowls with lids so that they can be put int he fridge to chill or over night, used to store leftovers, but also be great for actual mixing and prep. I LOVE that the bottoms have sturdy silicone bases so they don't slide around when in use, and I LOVE that the bottoms are color coded to match the lids, there's no guess work when you need to grab a lid! I love that they nest, and there are many sizes. I really, truly couldn't love these bowls more, no negatives!\", \"Title: Nice Set of Durable Mixing Bowls; Content: These mixing bowls are great. I love that they're nesting, so it cuts down on the amount of storage space needed. They're durable, look good, and are easy to clean. The only thing I'm careful about is if I need to marinade with them. If I use lime or any other citrus juice, I tend not to use these. Only because you should use a non-reactive material if you're going to marinate with acidic citrus juices. Otherwise, these are great. I would definitely recommend them.\", 'Title: These Are Made With Quality; Content: If you have ever struggled to keep your bowl steady on the counter while using a mixer then you will appreciate the rubber bottom on these bowls. 3 other things I really like about these bowls is: 1. They are stackable - perfect when space saving is a neccisity 2. They each have their own lid - makes it perfect for storing leftovers 3. A nice variety of sizes - 1.2Q to 5Q An added bonus is the how colorful they are.', 'Title: Love them; Content: I got rid of all my other bowls. These work for mixing, food storage and you can even use them for serving. They nest perfectly, and you really only need these?', \"Title: great mixing bowls - poor lids; Content: This is a great set of mixing bowls. I love stainless steel for cooking and food prep, and these are solid and well made. They are the first set I have used with a non-skid base, and it works pretty well - much better than bowls without the base. This is a particularly nice touch, as it can be extra taxing to mix something thick and heavy and have to fight a sliding bowl as well as stir the contents. While I was skeptical at first, I am now convinced that it is a must-have feature. The range of sizes is also very nice, and I am looking forward all kind of new food projects. The only down side is that the lids do not fit very well. They are the kind of lid that sits down inside the bowl rather than snapping over the top outside the rim, which I do not particularly care for. They also do not fit very tightly, and come off easily. However, I don't really care too much about lids, since foil or other kinds of wrap will work just fine. Still, if the lids are important to you, be aware that those are a weak point. It cost them a star. Other than the lids, I like these bowls very much.\", 'Title: The bowls are great, the lids not so much.; Content: We wanted this set for the rubber base - non slip and really stable. The bowls are decently heavy duty and easy to clean. The lids were a nice addition, but had nothing to do with us getting these. Good thing. Out of all the bowls, only two of the lids actually fit well and stay on. The rest are either too warped, too small, or are not deep enough to stay closed. The smallest one was all three of those. The lids have more of a plastic feel than rubber. The bases of the bowls are rubbery and really grippy, plus they have ridges. The fact that they nest is great, and they are dishwasher safe. A nice bonus is the scale makes inside all but the smallest bowl. Markings are in liters and quarts. Adding cups would have been a nice addition, but converting is not that difficult. Bowls - 5 stars. Lids - 3 stars.', \"Title: Lightweight stainless steel bowls w/fitted lids, measuring marks, & non-slip bottoms.; Content: These Wildone stainless steel nesting bowls have fitted lids to go with each of them, & measuring marks on the interior in quart and liter volumes. The bowls are shiny on the inside and have a brushed finish on the outside. The bottoms have a black silicone coating to ensure that they stay put on the counter/surface while mixing, or just resting. The weight of the bowls are light - much lighter than my Cuisinart stainless steel bowls that I've had for the last 12+ years. I like that the bowls have lids that are fitted. If you hold up the lip on the lid, the air will come out like you are burping it. I would not consider the lids to be airtight as professed since I find it difficult to get them to stay fitted & seated down into the bowl as is intended. The smallest lid arrived deformed (bent up). I wish the bowls had a place for you to grip them with your thumb/fingers like my Cuisinart old stainless steel bowls do. The price is steep for this set at $60+ right now, and I would not pay that much for this set. The durability of these bowls will be realized in the test of time.\", \"Title: Nice bowls, but could have better lids; Content: I like that these bowls come in a variety of sizes, nest so they don't take up too much space, and have lids. The bottoms have a silicon base that is nice for mixing but means you can't set a bowl over a pot of boiling water to melt chocolate or what have you, and stainless steel looks great but means you can't microwave them (again, if I'm microwaving a mixing bowl, it probably has chocolate). So they're great for mixing, but limited for some other uses I've come to assign to my existing mixing bowls. The lids are a very nice feature, but don't fit as snugly as I had hoped. I definitely would be concerned shaking a bowl to mix whatever is in it (like a dressing), even if I was holding the lid, and wouldn't just stick a bowl of something liquid in the back of my car and count on the lid to avoid a mess the way I might with some sealing containers. However, for what these are designed for (mixing and some light storage), they're still quite nice.\", \"Title: Great Bowls, but the tops could be better; Content: There is a lot to recommend these bowls. They look great in stainless steel and wash up in the dishwasher with ease. They are in enough sizes that you are covered for most anything. However, I found the lids to be a bit frustrating. They just don't fit perfectly and I don't trust them to stay on, even when I can get them to fit on the bowl. The question is whether you can deal with the lids because they bowls are great.\", 'Title: Good bowls/ awful lids!; Content: The bowls themselves I love. The metal is thick and they are well made. The silicone on the bottom of the bowl is a very nice feature and helps a lot to stabilize the bowl. Each bowl has measurements inside using quarts and liters, it would be nice, especially on the smaller bowls, if measurements in cups were used. The lids for the bowls are HORRIBLE!! They do not stay on and pop off immediately after putting the lid on. There is no grip to the lid and they are made entirely of a hard plastic. They are literally useless!', \"Title: functional form; Content: these mixing bowls are really great quality and beautiful to look at. brushed exterior and mirror finish interior. the capacity is laser etched on the outside with measurement marks on the inside. the black plastic lids fit each bowl well; just wish they weren't so stiff, but rather silicone or rubber.\", \"Title: Versatile; Content: These bowls have proven sturdy, flexible and easy to store. We use them for mixing, tossing and serving salads, and everyday cooking. We haven't used the kids at all. They are a little warped and we obviously don't have the need. I love that I can toss them into the dishwasher!\", 'Title: Fantastic nesting bowls with lids; Content: I already have a full set of nice stainless steel mixing bowls that I like. After running out of mixing bowls too often, I decided to get another set when the Vine program had some. I didn\\'t expect to like these as much, and now I love them. The metallic part of the bowl is sturdy, thicker than my classic bowls. The inside is shiny. The measuring notches on the side offer useful guidelines for volume. The lids are useful for storing leftover items like extra sauce, vegetables you didn\\'t use up and such. The silicone bottoms make these anti-slip, but that also means you can\\'t slide it across the counter. If you like to turn the bowls while mixing, use different bowls. These bottoms are designed to stay put. This is not a negative - it\\'s just different. These bowls are narrower than typical mixing bowls, so they\\'re taller. Some people may like that while others don\\'t. These nest nicely for storage without taking up too much space. The only improvement I\\'d make are on the lids. I wish they were dishwasher-safe. They also take some pushing and positioning to fit properly for maximum airtightness. I tested for leaks with the 3-quart bowl filled 2/3 with soup, put a lid on it, then flipped it. Amazingly (and thankfully), nothing leaked, and the lid didn\\'t fall off. While the lids work, I would NOT push its \"airtight\" claim. I\\'m just happy there are lids for easy storage. If you don\\'t want non-slippage feature for your mixing bowls, don\\'t get this set. If you want stability or need to mix using both hands, you\\'ll like these, like for pouring in an ingredient while mixing. Some sizes also make very nice salad bowls to eat out of. I love being able to use them for storage, too.', 'Title: Sturdy with a Non-Slip Bottom; Content: Out of the box, the significant other liked these bowls. The bowls seemed sturdy and well-made, and we immediately noticed the level markings in side the bowls, which we consider a huge plus. The significant other was initially chagrined that the largest bowl is 5 quarts, because she makes a few dishes requiring very large bowls. However, she has very large bowls, so these help fill in sizes she currently does not have. The point is that if larger bowls are needed, buy larger bowls. Of course, one of the first things we tried were the lids. Unfortunately, the lids do not stay as secure as we would like. The lids tend to pop up just a little bit in one or more places around the periphery of the bowl. We tried pushing the lids down with as much force as possible, but they kept popping up, though not completely. So, the lids will seal the bowls, they will just not stay all the way down. Each bowl has a silicone bottom to decrease sliding. We love the silicone because our countertops are granite, and stainless steel has a tendency to slide, particularly when the bowls are empty. The silicone appears to be well-attached, so it should last for many years. We both love the level markings inside the bowls. It can be challenging to measure quantities in bowls this large, and the level markings we consider to be a huge advantage. Of course the bowls nest or sit inside each other for storage, and the lids similarly stack to minimize cabinet space. Our rating for value is average to above average given the quality of the finish and the markings. We considered whether the inability of the lids to stay seated should reduce our rating of value and decided that the overall quality was high for the price. Our rating for these bowls is five stars even though the lid fit could be improved. The brushed external finish, the polished internal finish, the apparent thickness of the bowls, the silicone bottom, and the markings inside the bowls are all advantages to these bowls that keep our rating high even with the lid fit. Enjoy!', \"Title: Tough, easy to clean.; Content: Wildone Nesting Bowls x 6 are a great set of mixing bowls / storage containers. Being steel, they're tough when you use them mix things. No worries about permanent sauce stains like you get with plastic bowls. They have snug fitting lids making them excellent storage bowls. The lids hold surprisingly well. I took the largest bowl (5 quarts), filled it with 3.5 quarts of water, put the lid and held the bowl upside down. The lid held! I shook the bowl a little and the lid still held! On the 5 quart bowl the lid was water tight. On the smallest bowl there was a little leak but the lid didn't fall off. I would not expect the lids to stay put if you DROPPED a full bowl but I didn't test that. If you fill the a bowl with hot food and then put the lid on the steam will eventually loosen the lid and pop it off a little. You push the lid back on ... after a while the lid gets loose again. Put the lid on again and by now the food has cooled enough so that the lid stays put. Not a problem. Very easy to clean. Some of the lids became a little warped after I rinsed them with hot water. They still made tight fits on their bowls so I don't see that as a problem - just an annoyance. Good stuff!\", \"Title: Very good bowl set, dishwasher safe, marked inside for rough measurement.; Content: A lot of uses for a good bowl set. I make a lot of pancakes and waffles and make too much batter, and this is a good way to store it in the fridge. It helps initially with the water level for a big batch, then the bowl is nice for whisking in the mix. finally the unused batter can be preserved with an airtight lid to keep it fresher. The lid helps keep the rising quality of the buttermilk batter intact for much longer so the next time I use it, no flat lifeless pancakes. There are many sizes each useful in it's own way. I make cakes, cornbread, homemade soups and stews, tosses salads and mimic a local restaurants dish called a chop salad. As a single, I need to keep the contents sometimes for a few days, especially with things like my tuna salad, made with eggs, tuna, mayo, relish, shredded cheese, and chopped celery. I need it to last about three days and with the airtight lid it's fresh on the third day. Having convenient bowls to use with the whisk is good, scrambled eggs become fluffy, and can be easily made into nice omelets. The bowls themselves are interlocking for storage as are the lids, I can keep them in one place on my prep table. They are dishwasher safe, although I'd hand wash the lids. The bottom is silicon so it's harder to just knock them off the table by mistake. When I do juicing, I can use these as some storage containers to prevent some fruits and veggies from going bad too fast, or just to store them after cutting and cleaning. When I make my slow cooked marinated steaks and chicken, I can leave these in an airtight bowl for up to two days in the fridge for the tenderous meat ever. I love these, recommended.\", \"Title: Great Addition to any Kitchen!; Content: Wife's Review: I love this set! By coming as a set of six different sizes, they pretty much cover every size I would ever need. The measuring marks on the inside of every bowl, and the non-skid bottoms make them great for beginner bakers and having the lids so that I can store things right in the mixing bowls is wonderful! So far, the lids have fit snug, which makes me wonder about their ability to hold up in the dishwasher, since other reviews have mentioned an issue with their fit, and mine have not been washed in the dishwasher because it's broken.\", 'Title: Simple The Best Mixing Bowls Ever! Beautiful Stainless, Non-Slip Bottom & Lids!; Content: I have owned may different types of bowls over 55 years of cooking and baking. This Wildone set is the best ever! The bowls are very well designed with a beautiful polished interior including measurement makings etched into the finish. The silicone bottoms holds the bowl nicely in place and keeps the stainless steel from scratching anything. Lids! No more wasting plastic wrap to cover the bowls. Having the measurement markings makes it so much easier to make recipes together. All in all this is a fantastic deal on what I believe is the best bowl set on the market. I truly love these! Of course I could give it nothing short of a FULL FIVE Star rating.', 'Title: Compact, durable and versatile; Content: Mixing bowl sets are the way to go to maximize your options and storage space. Previously I had a mishmash of plastic and glass bowls that didn’t stack together and wasted space. What’s great about this set besides all fitting inside each other and coming in a range of sizes are the little design “extras”. Lids so you can store leftovers, cover while marinating or proofing dough. Also useful in proofing dough are measurements inside the bowl so you can measure if a dough has doubled, or use when adding ingredients. Nonslip bottoms mean the bowls stay put while mixing, but if I had to ding this for anything this also prevents them from being used as a double boiler or if you need to chill the bowl with an ice bath. Overall though it’s a good set in a range of useful sizes with helpful features.', \"Title: Only mixing bowls you'll ever need; Content: I have limited cabinet space so I love having products that stack together to save space. This set of mixing bowls not only saves space but it is all you ever need for mixing and storing. You get six graduated sizes of bowls from tiny to large. Each bowl has a silicone bottom so that it doesn't slip and slide around on your counter when you are mixing. Each bowl also has a snap on plastic lid so you use them for storage as well. These bowls are a nice heavy stainless steel that washes up perfectly every time. I have been really impressed with the quality and versatility of this bowl set and if you need new mixing bowls or need to buy a gift for a newlywed, this would be perfect. Highly recommended.\", \"Title: Very nice; Content: Very nice set of mixing bowls. Having an air tight lid for each if the 6 bowls is a huge bonus. Inside of each bowl is even measurement Mark's if you want to verify you are adding the correct amount without pre measuring. They are super slick and easy to clean. I have made bread dough, cookie dough, and even peanut butter balls in them without any issue. My metal utensils are not scratching or even leaving Mark's thus far. Very happy with the set and blvery glad I got them. Way better than my plastic Tupperware.\", \"Title: I love these bowls; Content: I realize these bowls are expensive but I still just love them so much that I can deal with that. They all fit together easily making storage easy. They have lids so you can save food easily in fridge. I think it is a stretch to call the lids airtight, as they don't stay on that well, but they work for my purpose which is to keep food good in the fridge. They have little things so you can measure things AS YOU PUT IT IN THE BOWL (brilliant). I wish they had cup marks on the inside and not just liters and quarts, but I guess it isn't that much of a big deal. Also note that you cannot use a mixer with them - the mixer scratches the metal. So they are best for hand mixing or serving or storage, but not for baking where you need your mixer. Overall very pleased even though they are a tad expensive.\", 'Title: Wildone Set of 5 Stainless Steel Bowls With Lids; Content: These bowls are amazing! 6 Stainless steel bowls that are perfect for my life style. I cook and bake alot, and its hard to find metal bowls with lids. I when use whipping cream I like to chill the metal bowl in freezer first with beaters, and now that I can just pop a lid on it after I whip it. The bowls are solid heavy grade Stainless steel, and the silicon for no slide around while cooking. Bowls are dishwasher safe but lids must be hand washed, and freezer safe. Smart investment', 'Title: Excellent for Mixing & Storing; Content: Industrial strength nesting bowls are ideal in any kitchen. The set of 6 resting and nesting bowls come in 1 quart, 1.5 quart, 2 quart, 3 quart, 4 quart and 5 quart. Each bowl is marked with its size capacity on the outside. The lids are BPA free which was a major draw for me. The bowls take up little space as they are nesting bowls. They are ideal for any mixing needs.', 'Title: Love this set and the silicone bottom; Content: I have been using the two larger ones to mix green salads. The whole set is of good quality and just the right weight. They do not get scratch marks like some of my other stainless steel bowls and I love the silicone bottoms that keep them steady on the table.', \"Title: Easiest set of bowls to store I've seen.; Content: Amazin how simple and effective this is for anyone who is looking to reduce storage space while maintaining their cooking quality. Bowls fit into each other like nesting Russian dolls. Lids seal tight to ensure spill/leak proof environment. Well done from Wildone!\", 'Title: Nice set of bowls; Content: This is a set of 6 stainless steel bowls in graduated sizes with lids. The bowls are marked on the inside with fluid volumes in quarts and liters. On the outsides, they have silicone coatings around the bases to make them non-slip. The lids are made with BPA-free plastic and slide into the tops. The steel bowls are dishwasher safe, while the manufacturer recommends hand washing the lids. The product was made in China. I have found these bowls very useful in my kitchen. As steel bowls go, these are relatively tall with straight-ish sides. For example, the largest bowl (5 quarts) is 9.5” wide and 5.5” tall. I have another bowl set that tends to run wide and shallow. With the other bowl set, I had to be careful about using my hand mixer because liquids would fly out the sides. But these Wildone bowls are nicely shaped for a mixer—whipped cream, for instance, stays put while you’re mixing. Whisking is likewise a cinch in these bowls. The lids of these bowls are a nice feature. They would snap on, but because they are air tight, they trap air so you have to force them down and they don’t audibly snap shut. The tightness of the seal depends on your room temperature since the metal and plastic are obviously different materials. Sometimes when I put a lid on, it initially fits snugly, then I watch it slide up of its accord due to air pressure. Basically, the lids do a great job of keeping odors in and spills out for storing food in the fridge. They also contain solid foods (like undressed salads) pretty well for traveling to potlucks. But they’re not entirely spill proof, so be careful if traveling with liquids in the bowls. Still, the lids work a lot better than plastic wrap. My other steel bowl set did not come with lids, so I use to have to cover food with plastic wrap and a lot of tape when I tried to travel with them. I’m so glad I don’t have to fight with plastic wrap or aluminum foil anymore. Overall, this is a very well-made set of bowls, with a good shape for cooking and handy lids.', \"Title: I love these...; Content: These are the best kitchen bowls that I've ever had in my arsenal. I use them for just about every meal I prepare and for every kitchen project. There are several things that make these standout... 1. The sizes they come in are useful. Other bowls are either too big or too small, these come in a variety that will fit whatever your needs are. 2. Storage capabilities. The lids are awesome. Yes, you will have to work to get them on but it is absolutely worth it. They fit snugly and keep what you are storing fresh. They are much better than aluminum foil and plastic wrap. 3. Storage capabilities, Take 2. These nest perfectly and take up minimal space in your cabinets. 4. The material they place at the bottom to hold it in place, ACTUALLY WORKS. You can easily whisk in oil and trust that the bowl isn't going to move all over the counter. It works very well. 5. Dishwasher safe. Legitimately dishwasher safe. They haven't warped or changed structure at all. The only thing that I can say that some people may have a hard time with is that they are thin. Not cheaply thin, just a bit on the thin side. A cook that is used to using either glass or plastic will have to adjust to these but in the end, it will be more than worthwhile. The price is excellent and you will find yourself using these over and over. A great find.\", \"Title: AWESOME Mixing Bowls; Content: I LOVE these bowls. We previously had mismatched mixing bowls of glass and plastic that took up tons of space, but those are all out the window now that we have these! There are 6 different sized bowls in this set from 1 - 5 QT, so you've got tons of options depending on the sizing you need for mixing or storage. They all nest together perfectly which is super convenient as they hardly take up any space. The bowls themselves are really well made and look fantastic too. The stainless steel looks high quality and durable. They have a black, silicone bottom that helps keep them in place and makes them non marring on the bottom. The lids themselves are durable plastic that should last a long time, but they're hand wash only and there's a warning they may warp in the dishwasher, so make sure to hand wash the lids only. The bowls themselves though are dishwasher safe which is nice. With so many bowls and different sizes they're a really versatile set that should fulfill any mixing bowl/storage bowl need you may have. There are measurement markings inside the bowls as well which is really handy when dealing with specific proportions for baking or for liquids. The bowls looks so nice that we often put them out on the table filled with veggies, crackers, dips, etc. and always get compliments on how nice the bowls are. This is just a really great set that can eliminate a lot of bulky, mismatched bowls that are already in your kitchen collection. Highly recommend.\", \"Title: A fantastic set of stainless steel mixing bowls; Content: I really love this set of nesting stainless steel bowls. Stainless steel bowls are my favorite because, you never have to worry about breaking one, plus they're super easy to clean. The various sizes of these bowls is also great. The largest one is great for making a cake, and the smallest is perfect for whipping up a few eggs. I also love how the bottom of the bowls are coated with rubber, so they hold a bit better to the countertop. The only thing that I do not like about these bowls is the lids. The lids are just rubber inserts, but the problem is, they came slightly mishaped, so they don't fit into the bowls very well. Hopefully over time they will go back to a round shape, and this problem will go away.... Overall they are great bowls, and I use them daily in my kitchen.\", 'Title: Beautiful, practical, slip-proof bowls; Content: There is one size perfect for every need, small or large. Smooth edge, rubber at the outside bottom, made of polished stainless steel they are decorative enough to be placed on the table. They even come with a volume measurement ruler on the inside. The lid is made of plastic, not rubber or silicon so they maintain their shape and things can be placed on top of them reliably. All in all, I am very pleased with them and can highly recommend them to anyone in the market for bowls for the kitchen.', \"Title: Good Set of Durable Mixing Bowls; Content: These mixing bowls are really nice.

See photo.', 'Title: Great .... but not clear; Content: They are sturdy and airtight but they are not clear like glass they have a very plastic frosted look. I made my own label but they came with stickers that are sufficient but it came with a dark blue marker that is pointless on a black sticker. Overall they do what they are supposed to but if your looking for super clear these aren’t it.', 'Title: Just a Guess on Durability, etc.; Content: As kitchen containers for flour, these will suffice, maybe even excel. I\\'m giving them a lower rating for two reasons. First, it was incredibly difficult to separate the bins as shipped. I\\'m guessing that many folks wouldn\\'t be able to do it. Not exaggerating, it took me 10 minutes to separate the first two. After I developed a \"system,\" it still took 5 minutes to separate the other two. My second negative is the way the lid and container mate. Three of the four mate fairly easily. The fourth seem to be ill-fit or formed. It is only with great effort that I can get top and container to mate properly. Happily, since they\\'re storage containers, it won\\'t be a daily battle to fight with them. Their upside: they\\'re large enough to hold more than a 5-pound sack of flour and seal well enough to keep bugs out. All factors considered, three seems like a fair rating.', 'Title: Missing one lid - Amazon wanted me to send the whole set back!; Content: Last week I ordered 13 pieces of these storage containers, and I liked them so much I ordered 12 more pieces this week - the total was over $100. Unfortunately, I am missing one lid from a large container, and Amazon wants me to send back the whole set to get a lid. I hope the manufacturer sees this and contacts me to send me a lid: 1 Lid missing from this container: Large Cereal Storage Containers, Wildone Airtight Cereal & Dry Food Storage Containers for Sugar, Flour, Snack, Baking Supplies, Leak-proof with Black Locking Lids - Set of 4 (5.2L /175oz)', 'Title: 3 for quality, -1 for not clear, -1 for blue on black???; Content: I purchased these for dog food storage so they work ok for me as the quality seems fine. SELLER: Listen to your buyers!! Update your \\'clear\\' looking product description, lose the blue pen on black \"chalk\\' labels when in fact it\\'s a regular marker (duh) and once you do yourself the favor of \\'bothering\\' to update and make adjustments, I\\'m sure you will realize greater sales. Competition is tough, people will pay a few more dollars for getting what is advertised and what they expect. Wish I could rate other than \"airtight\", \"leak proof\" or \"easy to clean\" to the criteria that other buyers are upset about. I think 3 stars based on the above is probably generous.', 'Title: Lasted 10 months before one broke; Content: I use these for cereal, flour, and pasta storage. They are easy to open, and airtight. The labels are nice and don’t fall off. However, one of the lids broke today after 10 months of having them. I open this container maybe 5x a week and they aren’t subjected to any heat or cold, so I expected them to last longer. If I were reviewing them last week I would give 5 stars but since only 3/4 are still still usable, downgrading to 3 stars.', 'Title: Two lids bent due to improper packaging; Content: Two of the lids were bent out of shape because of improper packaging, they were crammed inside two of the containers. Also, the product description online stated that it would come with a white chalk pen...instead it came with a dark blue permanent marker. The labels that came with the containers are black, which was stated as such online which I like, so the dark blue is not going to stand out on the black. Therefore, I have to buy a white chalk pen somewhere else when I have already paid you for one. Otherwise, I do like the containers and that they are BPA free.', 'Title: 3 of the 4 are good, 1 broken; Content: Arrived quickly and matches others I have but 1 lid was broken. These are shipped with 1 lid attached and 1 inside the bins, the lid inside one of the bins was broken. All in all I like these but the broken lid makes one of them useless.', 'Title: Capacity Not As Advertised; Content: The containers themselves are great! However, since these are advertised as containers for dry goods, I assumed 175oz would be the equivalent of almost 11 lbs. So, was expecting them to easily hold the 10 lbs of grain I was planning on storing in them...they only ended up holding a little more than half of that. Then I noticed on the bottom of the container that it is actually 175 fluid ounces. Not really sure why you would advertise a product for dry goods in fluid ounces...', 'Title: Okay size but not that big as picture description; Content: Based on the images shown, I expected the containers to be bigger than they were. I would actually research more and measure next time', 'Title: Misshapen and bad marker color; Content: They are packed in 2 container stacks, and the top container had air vacuumed out of it or something that caused the sides to bow in, which is annoying and reduces the capacity. The seal is very tight, even with the deformed sides. The stickers are black and the marker is blue, so it barely shows up.', 'Title: Watch out for the lid snaps; Content: Was looking good until I noticed one of the tabs on the lid got snapped off when they shoved it into one of the containers when they packed it in the box.', \"Title: Love them - they fit perfectly above the fridge; Content: Since working from home thanks to COVID, my worker bee organizer gene has worked overtime. Therefore, purchasing things to help the organizational process makes me a happy camper. Hence, these containers are good for crackers, chips, cereal - whatever you'd like to put in one place. I have three different kinds of cereal in mine (Cereal T, don't judge) and three sleeves of Premium crackers in the other (same company, larger container: Set of 4, 5.2L /175oz). I think it would easily hold the entire box of Premium crackers, and at least 20 oz of cereal, if not more. Comes with four measuring cup scoops (1/4, 1/3, ½ and 1 cup), a white, wet-erase marker, and the labels. The good thing is if you make a mistake, you just take a moist cloth, wipe, let dry, and do-over. A couple of tips: first, put them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes as they’ll separate a lot easier. Two, there is a bit of a new, plastic-y smell about them. However, hand wash them, and the smell goes away. Lastly, remove the inner stopper and replace it after the lids dry, or else it’ll take forever. Some have complained about the lids not being airtight. I don’t find that to be true, however, it does take a bit of finesse to line up the lid just right so you can close them on the four sides. Patience. I'll update once I can vouch for the durability.\", \"Title: Decent storage boxes.; Content: We purchased these to put our 5-pound bags of sugar and flour in them to help reduce the dampness in the basement so they don't harden as quickly. They are not the strongest containers, but doing there job so far. A bit hard to snap the covers closed. Be careful how much pressure you apply to close them, or you'll crack the covers.\", 'Title: Provides Formality and is Functional; Content: I haven’t finished setting up the pantry, but wanted to come and comment on the containers. I am so excited about these! Life changing to my pantry and family’s lifestyle. Hoping our cluttered pantry finds formality and function, yet practical for littles too. I have one less start because as soon as I opened the 3rd and 4th container. I dropped it, and one of the lids broke. *I have not contacted the supplier, as I feel it’s my fault for dropping. Just bummed it broke SO easily. Was hoping to be more sturdy. I have three boys.*', 'Title: Good product, good value; Content: Sturdy construction and good seal. The labels are a nice touch. The only downside is the dimensions of the containers isn’t listed and they are tall and square. Had to do a little rearranging in the pantry to fit them, but the quality is good.', 'Title: containers stuck together in shipping; Content: They work just fine. Only 2 things that I discovered. The storage containers came in 2 stacks each stack was 2 containers. They were stuck together in the stack and very difficult to separate. The only other minor complaint is there are no handles for lifting so I have to be careful to not lift from where the lids seal to the container. It is a normal grab point but may cause the lid to come off and the container to spill. Otherwise they work well for their purpose.', 'Title: Satisfied!; Content: Fast prime delivery. Multiple purchase of this product. I was not happy items were not included with the package. Stickers, measuring cups and markers were not shipped with storage containers. I did purchase these itmes in haste, without properly looking over the reviews of the past customers. I hope the manufacturer can rectify this simple matter. However, I am satisfied with my purchase.', 'Title: Not Bad; Content: My only complaint is I struggle to get the container latched at times', 'Title: Size is a bit off; Content: The dimensions say 6” wide, but only at the bottom. They are 7” at the top, so they didn’t double stack into my 12” cupboard like I had hoped. Otherwise a decent looking set with a large capacity.', 'Title: Got what I was looking for; Content: These are great overall. My only complain is that they come with 2 cups only when they are 4 containers. However, the size was what we were looking for, they seem quite durable, and they are air tight. Just make sure that you have enough space for them.', 'Title: Great Containers; Content: We are using these for our pantry. It is helping create space and we are able to see and utilize it more efficiently.', 'Title: Seems to fulfill purpose; Content: It is a good product but containers feel a little flimsier than what I would have expected from the photos. the containers come with side-locking lids which works but am worried how long the lid will last.', \"Title: Chalk pen is blue and dark; Content: Part of this is my bad...I didn't look closely enough to see that the marker would be blue. However, the ink is so dark it's pretty useless. Containers themselves are great. I was able to fit quite a bit of rice and flour in these guys.\", \"Title: Containers; Content: One of the containers arrived broken at the top, so the lid doesn't snap properly. Overall satisfied.\", 'Title: Very good product; Content: I love these containers the only reason I didn’t give them a 5 star is because one of them is messed up where the lid clicks on.', \"Title: Good product! Will buy again!!; Content: I love these! Gonna buy more!! The arent completely clear but that doesnt bother me. They send labels so you can label what's in what container. Only thing is, I didnt receive the pen that comes with it...so had to hunt down a metallic sharpie to write my labels out.\", \"Title: Love these containers!; Content: These are really nice containers for the price. Holds a 5lb bag of flour with room to spare for measuring cup. Just run hot water over them for a couple minutes if you can't pull them apart and they'll loosen right up. I noticed a reviewer talking about an odor, mine had none whatsoever. The only con which is a small one is the blue marker does not show up so I used a white paint marker. Would definitely purchase again.\", 'Title: Absolutely recommend!; Content: These containers are amazing! As soon as I open them, of course I clean them. I put soapy water in them and fastened the lid and when I shook them no water came out anywhere. They took me probably five minutes to clean. They dry really fast. In the picture I have stored 4 pounds of rice, 7 pounds of powdered sugar, and 7 1/2 pounds of brown sugar. They aren’t quite as translucent as I thought they were going to be but they still look very good. They come with multiple labels, which I thought was awesome. And they also come with to one cup measuring cups. I haven’t quite found a use for the fourth one yet but I know when I need to put something in it it will hold very well.', 'Title: Keeping it Fresh; Content: With the current pandemic, I am storing more flour, rice and beans than usual. I am always afraid of little creatures getting into things used for cooking. Hence, I try to take as many precautions as I can afford. I purchased a bundle of these a few weeks ago and liked them so much decided to go for more. So far so good in freshness and keeping it clean!', 'Title: Awesome containers; Content: Great containers, come with measuring spoons and labels. Will purchase more', \"Title: Saves money and looks good too!; Content: I decided I was tired of things going stale because of storing in the package they came in. I bought these, and several other similar sets and I have not regretted it. Since I'm retired and living without any growing boys in the house, my groceries tend to last a lot longer. These canisters are the perfect airtight solution. Everything lasts a lot longer, and sometimes I even get to use things up before they go stale! They look neat and tidy on my new black kitchen shelves, too. This frees up a lot of cabinet space, too. I can stock a better variety of canned goods with the extra space. I am very satisfied with this product.\", \"Title: Love at First Organized Pantry; Content: We LOVE these containers. I was so sick of every organization method I tried failing because as organized as I was... the methods just didn't work for me. I wanted simple, clean, easy to use, organization that would keep food safe and that I didn't need to buy tons of add-ons to maximize space in my small kitchen. I got these as a gift, loved them so much I bought 4 more sets and am ready to buy more... because I don't just use them for food storage anymore. You can literally use these for everything! I've got a set under my sink presently holding extra walnut sponges, extra dishwasher pods, extra magic erasers, and one that holds all the things I use to make my homemade carpet cleaning solution makng my life so much easier. These are great and really versatile! I have no regrets and no remorse purchasing. I'm actually looking forward to purchasing more to help organize our laundry room and to further organize and declutter our kitchen. Where were these before I spent all that money on silliness before?\", \"Title: Perfect for large amounts of baking supplies.; Content: Perfect! I organized my brother-in-love and sister pantry. This container was used for sugar, flour, brown sugar, etc. You can fit approximately 10 lbs of flour, sugar, etc I like these because they're airtight.\", 'Title: Perfect Fit For 5lb of Grain; Content: I bought a set of these to store some bulk brewing grain. I have found that the 5.2l version perfectly fit 5lbs of several different brewing grains. As you can see in the picures, roasted Barley fits with about an inch to spare. Flaked oats (oatmeal) is a tighter fit with less than a 1/2 inch of extra space. If you are looking for a different size, in my experience a good rule of thumb is 1lb of grain per liter of space.', 'Title: Keeps Food from Getting Stale; Content: Very nice canisters, was pleasantly surprised. They lock tight and have great seals on the lids. I used them to store Chex mix and cookies for the holidays, but will use for cereal and other foods as well.', 'Title: Great airtight storage containers.; Content: I buy my flour and sugar in bulk and needed some new storage containers to store them in. I was happy to find these airtight containers! They aren’t quite as large as my old ones (far left) but they’re still pretty roomy and I gladly sacrificed an inch or two of space to have the 4 snap airtight lid and better stacking ability. I also like the labels that were provided which gives everything a uniform and organized look. Happy with my purchase, highly recommend.', \"Title: Fantastic Value; Content: I hadn't realized at the time, but I actually really love that these ship with those black stickers and a white marker. Great touch and they did come in handy. I would have liked to see these be made of a slightly harder plastic material as the flex was unexpected, but it doesn't bother me really. I'll be storing green coffee beans in these long term as I roast coffee in my home and these should do the trick.\", 'Title: Perfect for the pantry for larger bulk storage!; Content: I was looking for some nicer looking containers to move my sugar, flour, corn meal and bisquick mix over into. These were exactly as advertised. When I received them I placed them (lidless) on the shelf where I planned to store them, and they fit perfectly! However, once I placed the lids on, the containers were a bit larger and they no longer fit on my shelf perfectly and cause my pantry door to pop open a bit. My mistake there, just beware to others. Pleased with the additional items as well: 2 scoops, labels, and white marker.', 'Title: Would Definitely Recommend!!!; Content: These were housed in a secure box on arrival, and each were wrapped to prevent scratching and sticking to badly to each other for transport. Each container will hold 10 lbs. of sugar, 10 lbs. worth of rice, and 5 lbs worth of shaped pasta (see all the pictures to show how full the container is with each amount). The plastic is thick and durable, the seal is black and secures well. I have opened these many, many times and they are still going strong. I would heartily recommend them to anyone looking at them. I have bought other sizes that match them for a well-appointed pantry, and it all looks really good!', \"Title: I thought I had pictures, but can't find them.; Content: These are great. I only wish they came one size bigger. No batter what the write-ups say, they each hold five pounds of flour or meal. I use them for white and wholewheat flour and I have a different bigger brand that will hold 12 pounds and one huge one designed specifically for rice. They are tidy and take up less room that I expected and the smaller ones (I bought them, too) have made our small kitchen feel a lot bigger. They aren't fancy or decorative, but if you bake, they are exactly what you need. The peel-off/stick-on labels are cool too.\", \"Title: They work for the purpose I bought them for; Content: I went crazy and bought 3 sets to try out. I have a 2 year old that gets into everything. These keep him out and he has tried to dump them and open them. I was happy with how fast they dry. My only issue was getting them apart as previous posters have mentioned. Flipped the one that was on top over and put between knees and pulled. This is my pregnancy project. I need order in my kitchen. So I ordered 3 more sets for everything else. No I am not nuts I just really like these containers. I didn't get the scoops but that is minor. Labels and pens were in the package. Lastly I had no weird smell with mine so I don't know what the other poster was talking about.\", \"Title: Great product; Content: Absolutely love these containers! I even bought the smaller size. Here in Florida we have a palmetto issue. They like to chew my through my ziploc bags and the food boxes in my closet. Yes bugs chew through boxes and bags. I caught them multiple times. So I got these and I've noticed the decrease in seeing them in the closet now. And I save money from not having to throw food away.\", \"Title: as small as Tupperware.

But will keep them anyway because I don’t want to go through the return process.', 'Title: Make sure to count the pieces.; Content: The containers are good….. but I was shorted a lid on my order…..', 'Title: Not clear plastic; Content: I love the sizes of the containers but they are not a clear plastic like shown in the picture. Very much remind me of Tupperware.', 'Title: Easy, clean, reliable; Content: I love these containers! They are super easy to fill and stack. It makes everything in my cupboards look cohesive and clean. The food stays fresh and nothing spills out. You can pour a lot into the containers because there’s a little pop up space between the containers and the lids. The only thing I dislike is that you can’t easily wipe off the pen writing. I had to change the stickers if I wanted to put something new into the containers. So I suggest being broad with your labeling. For example nuts, bars, etc. However, the stickers come off very easily and don’t leave paper marks. I bought two sets because I liked them so much. -wife', 'Title: Not clear, as pictured.; Content: The containers are not clear as they are pictured....more like hazed or cloudy.

They are nice looking and seem to be very sturdy. I was looking for containers that would fit entire boxes of pasta so I wouldn't have to store them in the original boxes and they would look nice in the pantry, and I was not disappointed. Of course, what fits into one container largely depends on the type of pasta. Here's what I found out when I went to fill them. Entire normal size boxes of Ziti, Penne, Rotelle, Shells (Great Value brand which does not specify a size but they look to be about medium), and GV bowties all fit into one container nicely. Also, I fit a 13 oz. box of potato flakes into one container. Depending on the shape of the pasta, some have a little bit of head space while others fill them completely. I was able to fit almost an entire 2 pound box of macaroni into one container. On the other hand, I could only get about half a pound bag or so of wide egg noodles into one container. I will probably look for something larger for those kinds of things or maybe just use two containers. I hope that helps anyone who wants to store things like that. I hadn't seen anything like that in the reviews I read so I had to just guess at the size based on a container I had at home that was approximately the same size. Bottom line, it depends on what you want to store in them and what your expectations are. They are pretty much the perfect size for my needs. I only gave four stars because I haven't had them long enough to really know how they will hold up but they seem very sturdy. I like the fact that they are sheer enough to see what you have in them even without the labels. The labels are really cute and an added bonus. I do agree with others that the blue ink doesn't show up. It's really too bad because the pen has a nice point on it which makes it very easy to write on smaller labels. I've been wanting a chalk marker with that fine a point but haven't ever been able to find one. I hope the lids will hold up to fairly frequent opening and closing because these are for a working pantry so they will get used pretty often. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and wouldn't hesitate to order these again.\", \"Title: They'll do ..; Content: They are smaller then I expected but I think I'm getting over it pretty fast,it takes about 4 or 5 containers to make one 23 oz box of cereal. So the whole 16 sets gives you 3 full boxes of cereal,I think the way to use these are like if you have alot of stuff in small increments like cookies,pasta,sliced fruit or cereal ..keep in mind these small ones for sure don't have a spout so you have to open all the four corners at once, but it still beats my kids throwing out one whole box to make there cereal versus a chunk of it,but I still have to help them pour out cereal or I'd be nervous.i put my containers on the microwave so kids can reach them also because I have to tall of kitchen shelves and hardly no table space.my small microwave only let's me cover about 8 or 10 on top ( in2 rows)4+4 and 2 on top.. if I put some on top ,but it works I guess.\", 'Title: Marker and stickers not a good idea; Content: I’m giving this product a four star because the marker that comes with the chalk board stickers does not do the job. The marker’s color is dark blue, therefore it doesn’t show on the black sticker. I had to print labels and stick them on top. It also takes forever to dry. I realized I won’t be able to wash the containers because that would certainly ruin the stickers as they are not water proof. I like how good the lids seal.', \"Title: Very small; Content: As mentioned in a review I read this morning ( my fiancé ordered these, not me ), these are advertised in fluid ounces not dry ounces and that makes a big difference. Easiest way to describe that: compare the size of a regular can of soda (which is 12 fluid ounces) and a regular can of Pringles (which is 5.5 ounces). I don't know many types of people who would store fluids in these types of containers. But I must be honest and remind you that all storage containers are measured in quarts or gallons though we use them for dry merchandise such as clothing or blankets. I don't yet believe these actually save us space since we are using multiple containers for one product (such as coffee and rice) that were in larger containers previously. They seem to be airtight, they do have a thick rubber seal in the lid. Thick plastic containers though I will wait to see how long the locking clasps last. I will of course update if needed as time goes by\", 'Title: MISSING ITEMS; Content: I would have given this item 5 stars across the board but the delivery did not include the stickers or marker as advertised and I could not find where Amazon provides a good way to simply report a missing item rather than a refund or return. HOWEVER, These containers are awesome and a nice size for kitchen cabinets and most products you would put in them. These containers can accommodate the 2-lb bag of sugar or flour and 16-oz box of pasta if you need a baseline reference.', 'Title: Good quality , please check and make sure of the size and capacity that you are expecting; Content: Quality is good. I have not started using it. Though the capacity is as mentioned, the pictures are misleading. It is comparatively very veery small for flour , cereal, etc:( . I also got blue chalk pen instead of white pen. Delivery was faster...i needed it very urgent as i was in middle of organizing my pantry, but i am stuck with blue pen. No time for me to return and get a bigger size container also :(', \"Title: They're ok but...; Content: Way smaller than expected. Sturdy, awkward fit in small pantry because their shape is not even. So they kind of take up unnecessary space. Still, they did the job.\", 'Title: Good product, but containers are not as clear as Sales pics depict; Content: Containers were fine, but pics looked much more clear or acrylic like. If you are going for continuity and aesthetics, they do not look like acrylic does.These are see through but cloudy.', \"Title: food containers; Content: They are air tight and easy to close plus they look good. they we not as big as they said. Should have fit a box cereal wouldn't come close more like a box brown suger\", 'Title: No Customer Service Number If There Is a Problem; Content: I like the size of the containers and that they can hold a variety of dried goods. What I am not happy about is that I received one of the containers with a broken seal. And there is no customer service number to call for a replacement one.', 'Title: Food storage; Content: Bought these food storage containers and the are great. Just what i was looking for.', \"Title: Great value stackable storage containers; Content: The size is great for small containers of specialty flour. The labels sent with the containers are useless - they are cute chalkboard style stickers but come with an attached blue marker that doesn't show up when written on the stickers. I don't have any existing markers and pens that will show up when written on the stickers.\", 'Title: Ok for the price; Content: The containers are nice. Not the most durable and high quality but will do the job. The lids don’t all snap as tight as I would like. One of the containers was broken at the bottom. The labels don’t work with the markers they send, the blue is barely visible.', 'Title: Stackable and perfect size; Content: Liked the product as it was the perfect size for all my Flour, seeds, rice etc. only complaint is there was no marker in box to label each item. I had to use my eyeliner pencil', 'Title: What I ordered, but not the same as picture.; Content: The containers are great. Airtight, strong. They are what I needed for my project. The picture shows the containers clear. What I recieved was opaque. I picked them for the fact that they were clear. But these work.', 'Title: Best you can find for leak proof!; Content: They are small but since I don’t have a lot of space they are perfect!', 'Title: Nice smaller sized containers; Content: I just started to organize my pantry, and it takes a lot of work to figure out quantities and sizes needed to hold everything and fit the space. These smaller containers are perfect for smaller quantity items, but still hold a lot more than I expected. Top shelf in photo, I have these 16 containers sitting side by side, and they take up just under 6 feet of space. They included one extra lid, so if one happens to break, I have a spare. The labels in my photo came with another set of containers. The actual labels are the same shown in the product- they’re nicer than what I used.', 'Title: Good value; Content: Good deal for price. I cannot attest to leak proof feature as I am using for dry goods only. Also unable to speak to airtight feature as I have just started using so not sure how they will hold up long term. What I can tell you is they wash up well, easy to dry, stack nicely. I hand washed so not sure about use in dishwasher. Labels are large enough to write on though the marker they provided is blue and very hard to read, need a white marker for the black labels. Size was adequate for many different items like nuts, crackers, baking ingredients, candy, etc.', \"Title: Awesome Storage Containers; Content: These things are great. They're solid plastic and seal tight. I use these for all my sugar, salt, coffee beans, and all sorts of things. The labels are well made and make it easy to sort. The seller even included an extra lid and extra labels, which was nice of them. Some people are a little confused on the sizing. They hold 1.6L which is 54 fluid ounces. Fluid ounces is a volume, ounces is a weight. These aren't huge containers that will hold a mega-family sized box of cereal in one. I would describe them as a medium sized container.\", 'Title: Very organized and looks neat!; Content: PROS: I absolutely love how organized and neat everything is! The chalk sticker and pen are a bonus. Received compliments on how tighty it looks. CONS: Much smaller than I expected but after putting everything away it all fit perfect. Had to buy large ones for flour, rice, beans and pancake mix. Overall I would buy them again! Love having everything in its place. It keeps the food fresh and not stale.', \"Title: These containers are perfect for keeping your pantry and cabinets organized and used efficiently; Content: I really like that you can see everything, and don't end up buying items you already have.\", \"Title: Might be obsessed...; Content: I was never one to organize my pantry... why? It's behind closed doors and no one will ever see it. Well, this set has changes my life. They were so easy to clean and dry, they came with a set of stickers and a white chalk marker, everything can be organized and labeled. I am so happy with my purchase.\", 'Title: Very nice; Content: They are very nice, appear well-made. I haven’t unwrapped all of them yet but there is a minute scratch on the one I opened. It was tough getting it apart from the others. But they are packaged appropriately, they are stacked with each one being in an open bag that covers the sides and bottom to protect them. The stickers are nice but the pen doesn’t show on them. I have other pens that will work, so no problem. I consider the stickers and pen a free add-on. I would definitely buy the containers again and may buy other sizes. Very good value for the price.', \"Title: Great Organizational Product; Content: The pantry had become such a disaster area we couldn't find anything and often bought duplicates of what we already had. I looked and looked then settled on these containers to organize what I could put into them. We sometimes get a mouse in the house and having these definitely prevents contamination by rodents. they look great and we can now find the flours, sugar, nuts, beans, rice and everything else so easily!\", \"Title: Good for pantries or organizing; Content: MOTHS!! Our pantry was over-run. We got some Member's Mark containers in a variety of sizes, and those are good, but we wanted to put EVERYTHING in a container, so we ordered these snap lid containers in 2 different sizes. They seal well, feel durable, and they feel like they can survive being dropped, etc. I may end up ordering more for other parts of the house.\", \"Title: Organize your life boo!!; Content: I haven't put the labels on yet and I'm not done organizing quite yet. But here's the progress, before and after pictures attached. Doing this much has already brought some serenity to my life. I feel so much less stressed already! I can't wait to have it fully organized. I'm also doing my cabinets in the kitchen as well. These containers are amazing!\", 'Title: Great for keeping in kitchen cabinets; Content: We have a ton of containers because there is a baker & chef in our house. These in particular we use in our kitchen cabinets for the flour, sugars, and different forms of tea. We have bigger containers in our pantry that we use to refill these smaller ones. The baker does not complain about these containers.', 'Title: Excellent storage for apartment kitchen units; Content: The item meets and exceeds expectations. It was packed nicely and arrived on time. I am not a fan of writing the contents on labels, and use a label maker, but the plastic quality of the containers and the lids along with the washers on the lids are really good. I should have bought this item a long time ago.', 'Title: Bought for RV; Content: I wanted something that fit in the cabinets, kept food airtight, and made it more difficult for anything to get into. These are great! They are a perfect size, come with the right amount of containers, and I love the cute little labels. Mine even came with an extra lid.', \"Title: Perfect for 1 to 2lbs bags of dry goods; Content: I LOVE these! Other reviews mentioned that they are small. However, I find them perfect for 1 to 2 lbs bags of dry goods such as beans, rice, etc. They're easy to open and airtight.\", \"Title: AWESOME; Content: My pantry is super organized and the perfect size. Doesn't quite fit a full box of cereal but thats a family size. I'm glad I bought these and I ordered another set after I received these. Worth the money, I looked for a long time before I ordered these.\", \"Title: Airtight; Content: I'm a homebrewer and while I have a larger 5 gallon airtight container for my base bulk grains, I use these smaller containers to store my specialty grains, corn sugar, etc.. The only complaint I have is that when they arrived, my wife had to help me pull them apart as they had become stuck and created a vacuum.\", 'Title: Amazing!; Content: My pantry looks so much better after purchasing these! I though they would be larger, but for the price I cannot complain! I just wish the marker was white instead of blue, as it is a little difficult to see the writing on it. Would purchase again.', 'Title: Great storage containers at a very reasonable price.; Content: These containers are airtight, easy to clean (even the gasket in the lid comes out easily), and they stack nicely. They hold more than they look like they will hold. They were packaged well with thin plastic bags separating the containers as they come nested into each other. Each lid is contained in its own thin plastic bag. The lids were a little stiff at first but just gently bent the flaps down a couple of times and they were fine after that. Very happy with this purchase and my pantry looks amazing too!', 'Title: Way to small; Content: These are a lot smaller then they come across as the four small containers are barely big enough for a half box of cereal and the big ones are big enough for like 3 pounds of flour i wish i never ordered these this may be one of the last times i order on amazon', 'Title: Waste of $30.....very disappointed; Content: Tiny tiny tiny tiny.. not worth $30 AT ALL!!!!!! I planned to use it to store cereal on the kitchen counter so my children are not on the pantry getting cereal boxes every day...these containers are so tiny I would have to refill it EVER DAY....which means going on the pantry ever day...such a waste of my money....container the size of one bowl of cereal...very disappointed', \"Title: Damn Right Airtight; Content: I bought these containers for my kitchen, flour, sugar and so forth and I'm sorry I did. There were two larger containers and four smaller ones. I pulled two of the smaller ones out of the box together, one nested inside the other with some padding material between them. They were hard to pull apart and so was the next pair, but I got them separated. The two bigger ones, though, seemed welded together. I tried as I had the smaller ones, fingers pushing down and thumbs pushing on each side of the containers. Nothing. I tried getting fingers between them to let some air in between them. Nope. I tapped them on the counter. No good. I tried for over ten minutes and finally decided they were going to come apart one way or another. I went outside and parted them with a sledge hammer, but they're not gonna hold flour now. I don't know what idiot decided to put that foam crap between two very smooth surfaces then jam them together until an almost perfect vacuum was created, but he should lose his/her job. If he's a degreed engineer, he should contact his alma mater about a refund on his schooling then look into getting a real estate license.

The sizes that were advertise aren't quite what one thinks.\", \"Title: Not the size you think; Content: Containers appear large on the photo which is very deceiving. There is no way a box of cereal will fit into the smaller containers as depicted on the photo. A 5lb bag of sugar or flour won't fit in the larger containers.\", 'Title: Disappointed; Content: Although the above titles were rated high, I am disappointed with this product because it is opaque rather than clear as advertised. And the size in the pictures are deceiving. The larger container holds only 5 lbs of flour not an ounce more. Be careful to read the dimensions rather than going by the pictures.', 'Title: Meh. Wouldn’t buy again; Content: So these came with cute stickers that you can write on. However the marker they sent was a darker blue and does not show up on the black stickers. A white sharpie might. Basically useless. Second, the larger container aren’t as big as I thought.

Not happy with these', 'Title: Too small for food, used for crafts and screws instead; Content: The pictures are deceiving. They are too small to be useful for flour and sugar. Telling me the dimensions in liters was not helpful, and the pictures blew up the appearance of the actual size. I ended up using for crafts instead.', 'Title: Too small; Content: This is not like the picture! I read all the reviews and it said you could put a 5lb-7lb bag of flour in the larger container so I assumed you could. These are so small! Save your money and put it towards a better brand or something you can see in person to get a better idea of the size.', 'Title: not worth the price; Content: Just so you know they make the items look bigger in the picture and these are dollar tree items theyre not worth the price and theyre tiny. You can fit a tiny bag of sugar in it not medium', 'Title: Unfortunate Redesign; Content: They changed the design, which is a bummer in my opinion. I bought these as a reorder. The original purchase containers had smooth sides, good for labeling. The new reorder containers have these uneven sides, with indentations that I DO NOT WANT.', \"Title: Much Smaller Than Expected; Content: I bought this with the intention of using the biggest two to store my 11lb bags of protein powder in...and yeah if I didn't have a seperate actual 5lb jar already, I would have used the entire set for just one 11lb bag.

Oh, and to top it off... no free returns. Taking off an extra star for that.', 'Title: Not made of the same materials as in the pictures; Content: What they send out is a much cheaper version of this product. The \"clear\" plastic that makes up the body of the containers isn\\'t clear like in the pictures. It\\'s cloudy and clearly cheap. It might be worth it if the price was reduced about 80%.

I'm sorry I was looking for the container where my spaghetti noodles would fit and pounds of sugar will fit. These are tiny cannisters for me. One more thing unpacking the cannisters was a big challenge. It's stocked up. I hurt my fingers pulling to separate the two. This is not funny. I'm not sure if I will just return it.

We were hoping for some good sized containers to store cereal and hoped these would work. There are two larger containers shaped flat and wide which work for flour, sugar. However, the taller containers are way too small for cereal. Large enough for a small bag of rice but not a box of Rice Krispies. Disappointing. The shared photo shows a piece of fruit next to a couple stacks of 2 of the containers. They are shorter than this once they are separated.', 'Title: The picture is misleading.; Content: These are actually much smaller in person. I was disappointed when I received them however, with corona out there, who really wants to go out to do a return now. Anyways, I used them and they weren\\'t so bad after all. I just wish they were taller and big enough to actually hold the entire contents of a cereal box. The 2 \"bigger\" ones are fine with me tho. I use them for rice. Its the 4 little ones that are really deceiving.', 'Title: Big one was misshaped; Content: The reason I gave this a 3 star review, is one of my large containers is misshaped. Both sides are bent inward. Unfortunately I ordered them for my vacation home and didn’t open them until the return window had closed. I also find it odd that the labels are black with a blue marking pen. This makes it difficult to read. Other than that, the other ones seem sturdy and work well.', \"Title: A lot smaller than I expected; Content: These seem like good quality but they are a lot smaller than I expected.

Just be warned: they are much too small to store flour and sugar.\", 'Title: Much smaller then pictures show; Content: I am a smaller women, and the largest container is as big as my hand.

This review would have received more stars; however, the containers are not very large, so I would not recommend these for a large operating household, more so for a single person or maybe a couple just starting out.

This makes it difficult to see what you have written.', 'Title: NOT AS BIG AS YOU THINK; Content: Based on the pictures you would think that these containers could hold at least a box of cereal or bag of flour, you’d be wrong. They are made of good quality and easy to clean BUT they are WAAAAAAAAY smaller than pictured and described. Since it’s just me and my husband this is just ok but I will have to refill containers often. For a family larger than 2 keep looking for another product.', 'Title: SMELLS WEIRD; Content: When you first get it, it has a super strong odor that I can only describe as crayons that were melted in a car’s exhaust.

They advertise flour, cereal etc. I'd say in the large container it would take 2 to hold a 5lb bag of flour...\", 'Title: Disappointed by size; Content: The picture makes these look perfect. In reality they are soo much smaller than I thought, before you buy pay attention to how much of anything you need these for, the small boxes will maybe hold 2 bowls of cereal and the large one barely hold a small bag of flour. They seem to be pretty sturdy though.', 'Title: Very deceiving; Content: Yes they look to be air tight, easy to clean and things are fresh but these are a lot smaller then they look you can’t fit a bag of sugar in any of them they are very small compared to the picture.', \"Title: Small; Content: These are small but they do they job however I wouldn't have bought them if I knew they were this small.

So far, they get the job done, but the walls of the containers are thin and flexible. I have other sealed containers that are much more sturdy. So far the seals have held, but with as flimsy as the containers are and as thin as the walls are, I am concerned that I may have to replace them soon.', 'Title: Way too small; Content: you can fit a box of cereal in the large container and the smaller ones are fine if you live in a smaller apartment or studio.', \"Title: Nice and clean looking but a little smaller than I expected; Content: Slightly smaller and more lightweight than I expected but very clean and nice to use. The lids fit very well and snap shut nicely. They comes with black labels and a dark blue marker which makes no sense. You cannot read the writing. You'll have to order a white poster paint marker to use them. If they were $20 instead of $33, I'd order another set.\", 'Title: Excellent for bulk foods!; Content: Durable containers, not the hard plastic that easily cracks and breaks. 4- sided locking system keeps food items sealed up tight. Extra labels in case you change the flour container to powdered sugar 😁 - and stacks perfectly in small kitchen spaces.', 'Title: Read the product description before purchase!; Content: I failed to thoroughly read the description, so I was a bit upset over the size of the containers. The two larger containers were perfect for flour and sugar. The smaller containers I was planning to use for cereal but they are way too small. So I found other uses for the smal containers; dry beans, powder sugar, brown sugar, and piloncillo(mexcian brown sugar). My search for a good cereal container remains but overall I am quite pleased with these and will probably order more to store other dry goods. Such as bulk goods I get from the grocery store(pasta, rice, candy, ect). The lids seal tightly, however I am concerned over cleaned with the rubber seal. I will try to update if I remember after a few cleanings.', \"Title: Look good, seem like they will work; Content: Overall these seem good. They aren't really clear but look nice. They are a bit more flexible than I had hoped so filling them up then squeezing the sides when you pick them up can sometimes spill. One thing I do want to include because it was the main reason I bought these is that 5lbs of packed flour will fit easily, however just dumping a 5lb bag in will likely overflow if you don't stop and pack it down a little.\", 'Title: Basic, no frills, airtight storage; Content: Okay, so you won\\'t win \"Kitchen Decorator of the Year\" for having these in your kitchen. So what? I live in a rural area, and when the weather gets cool, I get mice that want to move into the warmth. I\\'m not interested in sharing my dry foodstuffs with them, and these containers do a great job of keeping the mice out. These are a great option for someone that\\'s just getting started in their own apartment or house, as well as being a great option for someone that moves pretty frequently and doesn\\'t want to worry about replacing glass or ceramic containers that get broken during a move. The fact that you can see how much rice, flower, sugar, etc., you have at a glance is (in my opinion) very much a bonus.', 'Title: Surprisingly Awesome... Lol; Content: Just opened these so I\\'m not sure about some of the questions but they seem pretty sturdy and they were easy to clean for the first time. I didn\\'t think they were large enough but they actually fooled me... Ended up rethinking the amount of \"stuff\" I keep on my countertops.

Do it!', \"Title: Wonderful storage containers But!!; Content: These containers are wonderful, they are water tight and easy to clean and look great. The only problem I have is they are so small. I can't put my sugar or cereal or flour in them and I don't buy large size items. If you are looking for smaller containers for storage they are great but for larger items look elsewhere.\", \"Title: Great containers, but marker came broken; Content: The containers are just what I wanted and the stickers are nice and large. However, the blue marking pen came broken. The tip was completely broken off. The color was a beautiful blue, but not much use if you can't write with it. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars for everything. I have other chalk markers that I can use, but I purchased the containers WITH the marker and stickers. Too much trouble to return just for that.\", 'Title: Not Crystal clear contrainers; Content: While the items them selves are still useful i specifically purchased these because in every picture in the description and in the picture on the box in the pictures i included as well it says they are clear transparent, while they are somewhat see through these are def not clear transparent containers like others i have purchased before i specifically got these because they WERE shown as crystal clear lookin even the lids are shown as crystal clear similar to the look of glass but these at least what i recieved were most definately not .That being said the items are still usable and useful which is why i left a 4/5 stars would def have been 5/5 if they were fully clear as described', 'Title: Just what I needed to get organized.; Content: Overall, very satisfied with my purchase. Perfect sized containers to accompany a few others ordered. Assigned it 4 out of 5 score, because one lid broke after only a couple weeks & had to through the hassle of an exchange of an entire box. Still happy with my purchase & hoping this isn’t a prelude to future problems.', 'Title: Great product, not the size I was expecting; Content: This product is great. I was a little upset to see how small they were. That’s my fault for not looking at the dimensions, I went by the pictures and seen they were able to put cereal and no way I can fit a small box of cereal in any of these containers. But it worked out side I needed these for my flour and sugar and so on. Very cute and happy at the end of the day. Always look at the dimensions 😁', \"Title: Smaller than Expected but Good; Content: The containers were a little smaller than I expected, but I like them. Easy to use and close and seem to have a good seal. Love the included labels but not the pen. Tossed that and used a silver Sharpie instead. Really helped me organize my pantry. Prefer square or rectangular containers over round, as they fit better in the pantry and don't waste space.\", \"Title: Good size, decent quality; Content: I think for the price, these are pretty good quality. They're not super sturdy, and the lids on a couple of them don't feel very secure. But they do stay shut, and are great for organization. The two larger containers are just big enough for a 5 lb bag of flour. The marker that comes with the labels, is blue, and doesn't show up very well on the black. Overall though, I'd purchase them again.\", 'Title: Containers are great, just use a different pen for label; Content: The containers themselves are great. Perfect size and easy to clean. The pen that came with it for the labels is another story. Mine doesnt write on a black label, as you can see in the picture. Either than that, at least the containers are clear and i can see what in them.', 'Title: Hard to read labels; Content: These storage containers are nice and easy to close. But I knocked off a star because they came with a blue marker instead of white — I didn’t notice that in the pictures. Blue on black is impossible to read in low-light areas such as cabinets.', 'Title: Smaller than they look in picture; Content: So when I bought these I was just excited to have some large containers. Please read description before buying. Picture is deceiving because they are actually smaller then the picture looks. They are great little containers though. When I received my package one of the lids where broken but it still function fine so I kept them.', 'Title: Great for pantry organization.; Content: I just received and it seems okay so far. Great organizing your pantry. It definitely cleared up my clutter of cereal boxes. The labels gave it a cute look. However, I was a little disappointed with the size of the smaller containers because it could not hold a 4lb bag of sugar. I was able to fit a 15oz box of cereal in the larger containers with extra room which is perfect.', 'Title: AWESOME AND LOVE THEM; Content: very nice containers.....GLAD I GOT THEM.....now way easier to see what u have and looks way less cluttered the containers were made exactly to fit what the products come in packaged and the seal really keep the food fresh', 'Title: Check size before you buy.; Content: The product is nice but I did not focus on how big the storage containers actually are before I purchased. The photos make them appear bigger than they actually are. A family size of cinnamon crunch had to go into one of the larger containers that are supposed to be for flour or sugar according to the advertising picture. The one shown as cereal containers could only fit about half the bag.', \"Title: Worth it.; Content: Absolutely love these the blend into anyone kitchen colors. The big ones hold at least 1 1/2 bags of cereal and the smaller ones hold about 2 bags of snacks. They really help keep you're pantry or counters organized and free of ugly boxes. Highly recommend they are worth the money.\", \"Title: Bigger on the inside!; Content: I didn't expect to be able to fit so much flour in the large ones, but I was able to get an entire 5lb bag with room for my measuring cup and tapping knife inside. The smaller ones are, of course, smaller. I believe I got ~3lbs of sugar in one. I didn't measure, just poured from my older container. The top is a little hard to get on, but once you figure out how it works, it's easy peasy! We put rice and flour in the big ones, and sugar, powdered sugar, pasta, and self-raising flour in the smaller ones. I couldn't be happier! The labels make them look cute and are easy to stick on. I've got another set in my cart, and I'm probably going to switch all of my containers to these things!\", \"Title: Love them even in the freezer; Content: I was so happy to see be quality of this product be so high. I was so fearful that it was gonna be flimsy little flaps that break after a couple of uses. But I was so wrong I'm so happy with my purchase. Keeps everything clean and neat in the cabinets. And easily accessible from my boys to use. No more stale cereal or Soggy chips! I've even use them in the freezer And they are so good to take the place of those flimsy bags you get Frozen veggies in. I will definitely be buying more and in more sizes plus thank you for the cute chalkboard stickers they are so helpful and cute pinterest worthy!\", 'Title: Generous capacity, compact footprint; Content: Got these to replace my Tupperware. These have more capacity and a smaller footprint than the Modular Mates. The lids are easy to snap on and they are airtight. They also come with stickers and labels (I was feeling unusually motivated/organized, and decided to label things). The labels remove easily for cleaning/repositioning. I did use a Sharpie instead of the provided marker.', \"Title: Not as hard to unpack as people make it sound; Content: I bought this because my 12 month old thinks it's hilarious to dump out boxes of cereal. The containers are airtight and durable enough to withstand his attempts to make my kitchen a floor buffet of cereal, and they make great impromptu drums! They are easy enough to open that my 4 year old can serve herself cereal, which is great considering that I have to chase around the 12 month old as he figures out new hijinks now that cereal liberation is off the table. When first opening the product I was forewarned about the difficulty in separating the containers, but it really isn't as hard as some of the raters said. Simply put your fingers on each side of the container and pull the bottom container slightly outward to release suction. Then they easily slip apart.\", \"Title: Well made product. Small storage, perfect for small bags of dried goods.; Content: They seem well made. The product itself is fine. I'll blame myself for ordering late at night when I should have been sleeping. The containers are way smaller than what I was looking for, they are nice though. These are fine for storing small portions of dry goods. If you are looking for storage containers for larger quantities of dried goods, these aren't them.\", 'Title: Love my new kitchen set; Content: I really really loved these containers and specially because it came with a marker & stickers to put names on it. I was actually planning to buy a sticker set & marker and to be true I didn’t even know it would come with that. The containers are very good size & material wise. Two big containers and 4 small ones are perfect and look elegant in kitchen. I spent 2 hours in cleaning kitchen after I filled the containers with food so rest of the containers and kitchen stuff could compliment the kitchen, lol! But seriously I am too happy with the purchase.', 'Title: Perfect for storing pulses and rice!; Content: Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Theee containers are made out of high grade plastic which means it’s super easy to clean and does not break easily. These containers can withstand a drop from your kitchen countertop easily without a minor crack. The lid sits flush with container and is definitely airtight!', 'Title: Exactly what we needed!; Content: These are exactly what we were looking for! The larger containers fit a whole bag of AP flour and white sugar. The smaller ones fit a bag of brown sugar, popcorn, confectioners sugar, and 2 large boxes of raisins. They are sturdy enough that my kids carry them around and I am not worried about them being dropped. (We even received an extra lid- most likely an error that was our benefit.) The labels are pretty and look cute on the counter. My only negative is the marker that was sent to write on the labels. Blue on black? Weird choice. I started one label (there are lots of extras) and could barely read it so I used a silver Sharpie and it really made them look cute. I am ordering another set for other dry goods such as rice. I only wish I could find the bigger ones.', 'Title: Great Containers- Ditch the Marker; Content: Nice and sturdy and airtight, they do exactly what they’re supposed to. Five stars to the containers themselves! The labels that come with them are great, but that acrylic marker beads up on the label. Just use a silver or gold Sharpie instead.', \"Title: Comparable to Lock & Lock; Content: I've been using sets and individual pieces of Lock & Lock storage containers that I bought in the 2000's. I love L&L but finding the larger sizes that match the ones I have is either next to impossible or they are too expensive. I read these reviews and the containers did not disappoint. I ordered on Friday, picked them up from a locker on Sunday and they were in use Sunday evening. I did not apply the labels -- I use masking tape and a Sharpie because once these are empty they usually get used for something else. I noticed one small difficulty with getting one container to lock completely but eventually it closed just fine without any issues. These containers also are about the same size as the rectangle Lock & Locks so they fit in nicely with the sets I have. Just about everything in my pantry is now in a container with a label, I can see what I have, and I've maximized my pantry space with the modular storage containers.\", \"Title: Nice containers.; Content: I really like these. As some have stated, they are not crystal clear as shown in the photo. But that doesn't really bother me. The only dumb thing was that the marking pen that came with mine was a dark blue ink which was impossible to read on the black label. So I had another set of markers and used a bright yellow which worked fine. They seem to be pretty airtight. The lids can be a little fiddly to get on, but once you pop the latches down, you know it's sealed. I think they'll work fine.\", 'Title: Worth; Content: Glad I ordered this. I loved the airtight food storage containers and dry food storage container set. The product is of excellent quality with I think cheap price. 4 medium containers and 2 big containers with measuring cup and chalkboard and pen. My kitchen looks arranged now and I labeled all the containers which made my work easy. I do not have to open all the boxes to see what I have kept in what containers. Containers hinge is hard which helps to keep the food fresh and healthy. These containers can be used for really long with no health side effects as this is FDA approved. Easy to clean and save lots of space in my small kitchen.', 'Title: Absolutely great!; Content: These pantry containers are absolutely great! I was finally able to organize the pantry,label everything and I am very glad I found them here on amazon. I was looking for similar products but all the major stores had them at quite expensive price. I have checked at Costco, Target and Walmart, amazon definitely has the cheaper version, yet still good quality product. They are decent size and fit very well in our pantry room. I would recommend them!', \"Title: Terrific canisters!; Content: I worked most of my life in commercial kitchens and like my kitchen/pantry to have the same type of organization. My current home has no pantry so everything needed to go on a rolling storage unit. My go to restaurant supply canisters just didn't look nice and I needed something a bit more decorative. These fit the bill. These are solidly made. The lids clip on all four sides creating an airtight seal. You can stack them to better utilize space. I don't love the stickers included (just a preference thing) so just grabbed my label maker instead. Even though the plastic is somewhat opaque when empty, you can clearly see what is inside each container.\", 'Title: Labels dress up the containers; Content: These look good enough for me to have them on my counter. The lids have locking levers on each side for a tight seal. The plastic is a good thickness and it comes with extra labels. The blue marker looks neat against the black labels although it is not a high contrast so it is not the easiest to read. However, the containers are see-through so the labels seem more decorative as it is not necessary to read them to know what is inside. The labels also wipe clean with a little water when using the included marker. Having these containers on my counter has freed up a lot of needed cabinet space and the black/blue matches my kitchen.', 'Title: Perfect for what I need!; Content: Just got these in. Love the tight fit of the lid. Perfect size for all our snacking chips. Love these so much I order more similar to these. No more torn chip bags! I love how organized my pantry is! I will be buying more!', 'Title: Measurement imprinted into the product; Content: The main thing I like about the product is that the measurements are permanently imprinted into the metal and will not wear off with repeated use . The nestle into each other and are of a good weight. Pleased with the quality of the product.', 'Title: Not as pictured!; Content: These containers were much smaller than anticipated. See the photos of the “large” containers in comparison to my hand. No way these containers would hold a box of spaghetti or cereal. I am sending these back as they are not worth what I paid for them. I will be looking at IKEA or The Container Store to find appropriate pantry storage. Please take down the misleading photos that suggest these will actually hold significant amounts of food. That is poor customer service and shady marketing.', 'Title: Not as advertised.; Content: No tall or large containers came in my purchase. Only 3 medium containers and the rest were small. Lids have gaskets but they and the containers are thin enough to press the sides in. I think I’ve bought lunch meat in sturdier containers. Not as clear as the picture would lead you to believe too. I was very disappointed! :(', 'Title: Disappointed/but love them!; Content: Disappointed, there is 2 broken containers (tall&large), 3 missing containers (2 tall and 1 large) and 3 missing black rubber bands for the lids. I hope you guys can replace these 5 containers and 3 black rubber bands. I love the containers just upset I paid almost 60$ for this product to be damaged and have missing parts. Please email me.', 'Title: Not the proper description; Content: They are great storage containers but the description doesn’t match what you get! It says you get so many in each size the small to tallest! I only got small and medium! I returned them and bought a different pack thinking it was an error and same thing! The box does days so many in each size and does not give you that! I returned those as well and went to Ross and bought what I needed at a much cheaper price', \"Title: MUCH SMALLER THAN ADVERTISED; Content: I got these thinking they was the perfect size for my pantry items even made a mock up because it has the dimensions listed...well the product I got is WAY SMALLER than what was advertised. I didn't even have to take them out of the wrap to know I got ripped off. Don't waste your money unless you are looking for a much smaller product. This is false advertisement at its finest.\", \"Title: Ridiculous!; Content: So I ordered this expecting it to be a variety of sizes since that's what the product image showed. Except it wasn't. I got 20 of the smallest container (top middle) and 3 of the next size up from smallest (bottom right). Then when I tried to return it, I was told it wasn't eligible for returns because is flammable and contains gas. I don't know if I just got messed up box or what, buy very disappointed.\", 'Title: Extremely disappointed; Content: Many of the containers were broken when I opened them. There were definitely not tall ones like pictured. When we asked for a refund they said it was not eligible because it was a hazardous material. They eventually did issue a refund due to broken containers but it is worrisome that they are classified hazardous. They also were not clear like pictured.. Just extremely disappointed overall with this product.', 'Title: Does not have BPA FREE symbol and NO FOOD GRADE MATERIAL symbols; Content: I was very excited with my purchase until: 1. I learned that this item is NOT BPA free or food grade material. At the bottom, it is not written that it is BPA free either. I could be mistaken but I think there should be 2 additional symbols. 2. Most containers came smashed in. See pics of both smashed and non smashed containers. I believe this is false advertising although with items manufactured overseas, there is really no way to completely verify this information. US law does require items that are BPA free to indicate such and have their produce registered / inspected with the FDA / BIS. This item is not. I will be returning for a refund.', 'Title: Do not buy this product. They are not as advertised.; Content: Do not buy this product. The storage containers were advertised to be clear. They are not . They are a cloudy plastic. I immediately went to the website to return them, only to discover they could not be returned to Amazon because the package contains hazardous material. So, I am stuck with over 20 containers that are supposed to be food safe, but contains hazardous material.', 'Title: NOT RETURNABLE; Content: This was not what I was expecting... the container sizes are much smaller than I had anticipated. Do not buy product. They are not returnable!! This is complete BS.', 'Title: Cheap!; Content: Very thin containers. Would not recommend. I would have returned but they do not offer returns on this product.', \"Title: Not as Advertised; Content: Received order today. The containers are much smaller than made to appear in pictures. There is no way they can hold a box of cereal or spaghetti. The lids were difficult to fit on the containers. I worry that the closures will break with repeated use. I tried to return it but says it can't be returned because of hazardous material. :/\", 'Title: Did not receive what was described and will not allow a return!; Content: I received my package and it didn’t contain any of the larger sized containers. It had a bunch of small containers about the size of bowls! I had planned to organize and am disappointed!', 'Title: Order a different brand!; Content: The largest containers are too tall to use in my pantry because the shelves are not adjustable. This brand isn’t returnable, but MANY others accept returns. Don’t waste your money and get stuck with unusable items!', 'Title: Inadequate and poor QA; Content: It does not include the correct amount of lids to containers. What a waste now i have to replace half of the set!', 'Title: Deceitful imaging; Content: Yes, I should have gone and measured a box of cereal to compare to the measurements listed or just been able to tell in my minds eye that 11\"x6\" or whatever ISNT as big as the picture seems but I didnt, and yes, that\\'s on me. However, I\\'m so damn frustrated and annoyed with sellers who depict their item as being more than what it is KNOWING that tired mom\\'s (or people) will not think harder before purchasing. They depict these containers as holding cereal and pasta and all these other things I wanted them for when really they are glorified containers for leftovers. If you\\'re looking for small a** containers than these are great! If you want something that will actually hold the contents of a box of cereal or bag of flour- then look elsewhere.', \"Title: Damaged but can't return; Content: I would love to rate this higher but I'm really frustrated. It works and they are great for the money and I'm so excited to have them. But.... One of the containers was broken when it was delivered. To the point where it's unusable. There is no way as far as I can figure out to contact anyone to get it replaced and they just keep telling me it's ineligible for return. So I paid for 23 containers and can only use 22. If they could replace the broken item I would change my rating because they work great for the price.\", 'Title: Much smaller than expected; Content: I should have read the dimensions before buying. ALWAYS READ DIMENSIONS BEFORE BUYING PEOPLE. Don’t make the same mistake I did. The largest one in the bunch can fit a large box of cereal almost perfectly. Other than that, they seem pretty durable, but we will see in the long run.', \"Title: Misleading Sizes; Content: The material seems fine and the seal is good but the images are highly misleading when it comes to the sizes of the containers. For example, the largest container cannot hold a standard 5lb bag of flour or sugar by a little less than a third of the bag. That also means that if you buy other things in bulk (as you probably would be if you're getting containers to store bulk items) like cereal, you won't be fitting anywhere near the amount of the bulk in these containers. Given that you cannot return them, these are now utterly useless for me.\", 'Title: Dissatisfied; Content: In the picture the containers look bigger but they are all small and the pen and labels never came with them', 'Title: Disappointed by missing items; Content: The containers were nice but they were missing the labels and chalk pen. Apparently, this is fairly common based on other reviews. The containers shouldn’t be advertised with the labels and pen if they aren’t going to come with them.', 'Title: Missing containers and labels; Content: I actually like the containers. They are nice and durable. The problem I have is there is missing containers. I am missing one container for each size. Also, the labels are missing. I got the marker but no labels.', \"Title: Not as large as you think; Content: These containers are a lot smaller than they appear. The large ones can fit a small box of cereal and thats barely. I couldn't fit everything. Policy doesn't allow returns and now I'm stuck with a bunch of small containers I can't use. By the way, I didn't receive the chalk signs either. What a crock.\", 'Title: Not as pictured and can’t return according to Amazon auto reply; Content: These containers are smaller than I expected and they are not clear. They are more of a frosted color. Very disappointed. I tried to initiate a return an Amazon has an auto reply saying they can’t be returned because of gases. I’m not sure why since this is a plastic Tupperware item.', 'Title: Not as sturdy as Rubbermaid, arrived cracked; Content: One of the containers was broken when we received it. Didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning all of them since we needed them after moving to our new house and a replacement set would not arrive on time.', 'Title: So-so storage; Content: I was a bit bummed to find out the largest size didn’t even fit a full box of cereal. I wanted to get organized and these helped but not as much as I had hoped. They get more narrow from the top to bottom so you end up with large gaps between them and less storage than if the containers were straight.', 'Title: No labels included; Content: Great containers. However it did not come with the marker or chalk board labels.', \"Title: Not quite right.; Content: Containers were a little smaller than expected. I also don't like that the top opening is bigger than the base on all but 1 size of these containers.\", 'Title: Worth the money; Content: Only issue I had is I was missing two lids and the marker to write on the labels. Other than that I love the containers. Airtight and sturdy…', \"Title: Not exactly what I wanted, but worth the price.; Content: I was hoping they'd be more transparent like they were pictured. They're not acrylic, they're more like the polymer that Tupperware is made of. My first order didn't come with the chalkboard labels (as I had read on many reviews) and Amazon would not send the labels unless I sent the ENTIRE order back. It wasn't worth it for me to send them back, as I needed the containers badly. If you have your heart set on the chalkboard labels, you are better off assuming these don't come with them. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with the functionality of these.\", 'Title: These are not clear plastic.; Content: One of the main reasons I purchased these was because of the description: \" [SEE THROUGH & STACKABLE] - The clear storage containers body are durable enough for long-lasting use, you can quickly see what inside just at a glance.\" While a few of the containers were clear, most were tupperware type plastic - you can see through, but not as clearly as I thought. I already have an ample supply of similar containers and purchase these specifically since the were supposed to be \"clear.\" All in all, they are a good product for the price, so I am keeping them.', \"Title: Love the food storage!; Content: I was looking for lots of containers for food storage. These are great because the lids are all the same size and you don't get confused finding the right lid. I like how they stack when filled, but they don't stack into each other nicely when empty.\", 'Title: It’s a go!; Content: I really like the way these containers seal from the 4 sides. The largest containers aren’t as big as I’d hoped, but I’m able to use them anyway. I’ve already ordered bigger containers to take care of the larger storage needs. I’ve noticed no odd smells. Nothing weird that would put me off. The husband gave them his seal of approval, so I think they’re a go! It’s a definite recommend from the Barkers.', 'Title: They are smaller than I thought.; Content: Product arrived right on time. They are of great quality and will do the job for which they are intended. I just thought they were larger .', 'Title: Mixed Feelings; Content: This product is great however when it arrived two of the lips that the kids connect to are broken and not in the box. This doesn’t allow an airtight seal one one of them and other is right next to where the lid snaps. I will still use them for items in my home that don’t need airtight seals, but it is disappointing that I can’t use them for food.', 'Title: Dependable; Content: Was aspecting the bigger tubs to be a bit bigger than they actually are, but still fits what we need in them! It does state that the kids are hand wash only so the seal doesn’t get damaged. However, water keeps getting under the seal and I can’t get the seal out. Otherwise these are wonderful!', \"Title: 👍; Content: Love these containers.

They are not the cheapest, but they are thick, sturdy, will last a long time, and give me plenty of storage options!

You can see what you have more easily, so you remember to buy things when you run out. The labels are really cute compared to other brands I saw and are easily removable. The only small complaint is the chalk marker is too dull. I just purchased a set of markers separately.

I bought these because the advertised dimensions show them to be 4.3 inches wide by 6.1 inches deep at the bottom but they are only 2&3/4 wide by 4&3/4 inches. Even at the wider topside , which is not what they show the dimensions for it's only 3&7/8 inches by 5&3/4 inches. For this false representation of the product alone I give 0 stars\", 'Title: Not that functional - better options available; Content: I would not recommend these containers for the following reasons: - These are too narrow for a 1 cup measuring cup. If you are looking to use these to store baking ingredients, I recommend getting containers with wider dimensions. - For storing cereals, grains, I prefer containers that have a lid that allows you to pour the food out of the containers without having to take to whole lid off and potentially make a mess. Though these are high quality, there are better options that are more functional and convenient to use.', \"Title: Smaller size than advertised; Content: Just received my package a couple of days ago and i'll be sending them back. The ones i received were about 2 &3/4 in X 4& 1/2 in x 11&1/4in. Which is at least a couple inches off the advertised size. Not a huge deal but not what I was looking for.\", 'Title: Only can use 3 containers out of none; Content: Not what pictures describe', 'Title: Broken Container; Content: Unfortunately, one of the containers were damaged due to the way they were packaged. I would like a replacement for the item that was damaged.', 'Title: Not Large Enough; Content: These are pretty small size. One cereal box hardly fills in a container. Description could have been better.', \"Title: Storage containers.; Content: I like these for all my bag foods keeps them from going stale. I don't use the labels for them they get ruined in the dishwater and dishwasher. Kind of a pointless aspect since you can see what is in them anyway.\", 'Title: Pretty good but won’t buy again; Content: Product is as described but it doesn’t hold a full box of cereal or a full bag of flour... so it defeats the purpose a little bit because I still have boxes standing around with the overflow', 'Title: Containers are correct, labels were not in package; Content: The containers are what i was looking for. I received the chalkboard pen, but the labels were not in the package. Anyone know how to contact the seller?', 'Title: They only send 8 lids for 9 containers; Content: They are missing a lid', \"Title: Not what I thought; Content: When I recieved the package which was 4 days late the box was damaged. I went through a pain trying to get help . It looked like it had fallen out of a truck on highway. They aren't clear clear kind of foggy. They can maybe fit 2 boxes of spaghetti noodles in one. The tops are cracked and cant get ahold of anyone to fix problem\", \"Title: Great product but not as clear as advertised; Content: I really like the containers the only reason why I took off one star is because the picture as advertised is deceiving. I was expecting crystal clear containers but instead they come a bit hazy. The product itself is amazing but again I don't like false advertisement.\", \"Title: Resting Storage Face; Content: Pros: Sturdy lids that resist the sneaky fingers of my 15 month old, attractive 'chalkboard' labels and marker that comes with the set, size that they hold is perfecto Cons: The containers taper out at the top which makes no sense to me - it just wastes space. For instance, I have these lined up in a row on top of my fridge. Because of the widening at the top of the containers, I can only fit 5 of them instead of 6. I know it seems a little ocd but it annoys me. Overall: great value for the price I paid, I love them and occasionally love/hate them when the 6th container falls off the fridge. (But the lid doesn't come off so, stars!)\", 'Title: Not as good as name brand but good enough; Content: Good product. The containers are sturdy. I’ve had snap ware brand containers for 10 years but needed more of this size. These are not as good as the snap ware brand. The lids and locking are much harder to use and you have to push down to hold the lid on while locking the very stiff clips. Snapware just does it better. But these were a good price for so many so I will keep them. I would return if I planned to use them for items I use more often or if I expected my kids to use them.', 'Title: Containers are decent, good price.; Content: Good quality containers for the money. Much smaller than expected, so pay attention to the dimensions when ordering! They do hold one full small size box of cereal. I would buy this again.', 'Title: Good value but not transparent; Content: Great price for 9 containers, I bought mine when they where $26.99, I like the labels they come with you label it yourself. They look pretty durable, but the one thing I was disappointed with was that they are advertised as transparent in all their pictures I thought that it was going to be the clear hard plastic that simulates glass that I was getting, but not at all, they are just regular plastic clear but cloudy.', 'Title: I wish these were bigger; Content: I really wish these held more. No family sized boxes of cereal for these so I still have boxes hanging out. They do give an overall neater appearance. 4/5', 'Title: Not \"Clear\" As Described; Content: These do the trick nicely, but when the description said they were \"clear\" and the photo showed containers that were clear, I expected them to be clear. Instead, they are rather frosty looking.', \"Title: Good size and durable.; Content: Love these containers. Very durable. Great size. Love the labels and marker that they came with. Only one think disappointed me though. The containers aren't as clear as shown in the pictures. But they are still great.\", 'Title: I like it; Content: I thought I ordered the variety pack of containers but I got all the same sized ones. Other than that I m well pleased.', 'Title: missing parts; Content: The containers are received but the package was lacking the identification stickers. Now I am having to buy the stickers separately.', \"Title: Great deal, fits all my pasta; Content: I love them. I'd been looking for tall pasta containers and most of them are expensive or a bit too short for spaghetti. So I was delighted to find this set at a great price for 9 containers instead of one or two!!!! They are very thick and study plastic and the snapping lids seem durable. They fit 4 pounds of spaghetti or 2 pounds of ziti.\", 'Title: Perfect size for organizing my kitchen shelf; Content: I bought these to help organize my kitchen \"baking shelf\", where I keep all my baking items, such as various flours (coconut, almond, tapioca), chocolate chips, and other larger quantity items, and they look great on my shelf. They fit height wise, just right but depth wise the shelf is wider so I also bought (Airtight Food Storage Containers - Wildone Cereal & Dry Food Storage Container Set of 16 [1.6L /1.5qt]) to use in front of these. They are the same thing but a smaller version. Between the two, I will have my shelves organized so I can see and find things quickly without having to search around a mess of small container and bags of stuff so old (because I can\\'t find them when I need them) that they have to be trashed. I am loving the look of my organized shelves. They all seem to be functioning as I would expect and the lids fit just right. I\\'m am happy with my purchases.', 'Title: So many uses!; Content: Our pantry is really my houses catchall! We don’t have anywhere else in the house to store anything. It used to be our utility room with random crap pilled into it. I found some scrap wood and built a much needed pantry to get everything off the floor. These little containers are the best! The absolute perfect size. A way to contain the chaos! I can see exactly what I have so we don’t over buy. I even put my house tools and thing in the extras I had. I bought two sets of these after seeing how perfectly they worked for us! Definitely recommend this product! I didn’t use the labels because well, I can see what’s in the containers already lol. I did cut out the labels and nutrition facts for my rice and just added into the container itself. Yes my room is full, but I know where everything is and I can easily access it all!! I’m just a regular mom who bought something I think others people could use! Great price! I didn’t get a discount or anything for this review. I have sent the link for these to my invite family!', \"Title: Very tall; Content: I love these containers ! Living in an RV we try to keep the bugs etc out of our pantry and these do the trick. ( not that I have a bug issue, just trying to keep it that way ) My only issue with these are they're tall, I can't stack them, but can sit them side by side with some smaller ones I bought that are stackable. It makes my pantry very organized. Forget using the stickers that come with them, things are always changing, as to what your storing in them, and you end up with empty ones waiting to be filled with the same item you had in it before. cereal is about the only thing that stays the same, as does spaghetti. I find myself using them on a as needed basis, and always have something stored in all of them regardless of what was in them before. Yes...I'd buy them again, and have ! You get your money's worth and I can't see them wearing out from usage.\", 'Title: Well Impressed!!!!; Content: I love these containers!! You receive them in a protected box, and each have plastic separating them so they do not scratch or stick together too tightly for transport. Check out the photos, so you can see the box, the wrapping, the extras they come with, and most importantly how much they hold! For one container, they held 2lbs of Radiatore pasta, and for spaghetti an easy 3lbs or better depending on how much you want to stuff them into one container! They are thick enough to be durable, not completely see-through but I was good with that (I can still see through them). The bands that seal the lid are black, and so far everything tastes fresh from the containers so I believe they are airtight. Plus, if you want different sizes that match, there are others available. Overall, I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is thinking of purchasing them!', 'Title: Great value; Content: I bought this product to increase storage space in my pantry. I am very impressed with the quality of the canisters and lids and they hold a full box of cereal. They also came with labels and a chalk pen! I will definitely buy the smaller sizes to increase more storage. Received 9 canisters for the price of two at the store.', 'Title: Perfect!; Content: If you’ve got a kitchen with tons of spices, lentils, flours, etc...this will be perfect for you. I’ve ordered 4 sets of these already. Extremely pleased with how much they hold (will hold a 4lb bag of lentils) and how easily they stack in the pantry. I’ve got a smaller pantry and these containers are helpful in optimizing the storage space.', 'Title: Great Airtight Storage; Content: Love that they are airtight, but dislike those fact that they are to tall for our pantry shelves. Went to do a refund and the vendor doesn’t take returns!! Their reasoning is that they contain/contained chemicals, gas, or something to that effect!!!', 'Title: Best purchase for my Pantry organization; Content: Absolutely love these! Best purchase for my pantry organization! I don’t have a traditional panty so we made one out of an old armoire by adding shelves! With a family of 5, it’s Imperative to have great tools to assist in organization. Will be purchasing other sizes. I have two different sizes now!', 'Title: Good quality and very reasonable price, sturdy!!; Content: I got this product after we got a weevil bugs infestation at our pantry room, we were able to save and keep the products that were still safe and also protect it from any possible resilient insect after we disposed the infested products and cleaned the pantry. Containers are sturdy and big, price is very good compared with Walmart and Target. Not only we feel \"weevil safe\" now, but we gain extra storage due to the optimized space on the pantry. Also when we got it said more than a week delivery time but we got it practically next day. Thank you seller', 'Title: Awesome airtight containers; Content: I really live this set. Use for cereal, rice, flour, that sort of thing & everuthing stays fresh. I like the size for my cupboards. Be sure to measure your space but I would recommend and buy again.', 'Title: Really good dry storage option.; Content: Love these things! They seal well, have really helped in utilizing our taller cabinets, and stack really well together. I would recommend stacking them alternating one right side up and the next upside down so they fit well together.', \"Title: Must have!; Content: Awesome product! Use it for my pantry and everything is organized and sealed. Didn't know it was waterproof as well, so that was a nice surprise! Containers are light and easy to see for stock levels.

Kids love it, so easy for them to make their own breakfast!!', 'Title: Works well; Content: I like these. They work well for our cereal. Will hold almost all of a family size box. Snaps tight. Also saves space.', \"Title: Great!; Content: These work great. Hard to tell at this point whether the covers will hold up, but they seem fine. They're not completely clear but they look great in my pantry with the labels.\", 'Title: Just what I wanted; Content: Good size to hold rice, beans, oats and pasta for long term storage. Lids seal tight. Added oxygen absorbers to help preserve food. I will buy more.', 'Title: Awesome and good looking; Content: I love these they look great and I love the chalk labels. So cute. They are a little tall for my cupboards but we made it work.', 'Title: These are perfect!!; Content: They are beautiful and a great value. Got them for my wedding, plan to sell 75% of them after and keep plenty for the house. So thrilled, they were individually wrapped.', 'Title: VERY SMALL....; Content: They said these were for cereal, but the even small cereals like coco pebbles does not come out of the hole they put in the top of the lid to pour it from. We always just have to remove the complete lid to pour the cereal. Also want to warn you about the size. They are short which is one of the reasons I ordered these. I wanted to be able to put our cereal in a kitchen draw, but the \"cereal\" size containers are so little, even a small size box of cereal will not all fit in the container. You still have a small potion left in the bags that you then have to deal with. They do come with a black chalk board sticker that you can place anywhere on the container, but the chalk pen they send is a dark blue which does not show up well on the black. It does stay well; in fact I had to take a damp paper towel to wipe it off, to change the name. Unfortunately it leave a faint copy of the word on the sticker, so I know eventually this will not do well... Hope this helps!', 'Title: Hardly anything comes out.; Content: I was so excited to order these but was a beey disappointed after using them the first time. I purchased these containers for cereal and to create a uniform pantry. While they are visually pleasing, they’re basically useless. It’s so hard, almost impossible to pour cereal from, even Cheerios and Fruity Pebbles. Don’t even attempt it with Shredded Wheat cereals or Cap’n Crunch. I have to constantly shake it around to get anything but we’re to the point now that we just take the lids completely off. Kinda ridiculous and I shouldn’t have to do that. Lol The price is nice, in theory, but invest a little extra for better designed containers. The material is nice, sturdy and keeps the cereal fresh. They’ll probably last quite some time though I may use them for baking ingredients or pasta shells. They’re pretty tiny also. They’ll only hold smaller boxes of cereal...that oversight is purely my fault though as the description does state the specifications. Overall, I would NOT recommend this product.', 'Title: Bait and switch!; Content: What an absolute bait and switch, don’t get fooled by the picture like I did, read the exact description.... the picture shows it holding dry spaghetti noodles, this this wouldn’t hold a dry spaghetti noodle if you broke it in 1/2!! Let alone a box of cereal, absolute scam- I’m PO’d tbh.... not an exaggeration, I think it would take 4 of them to hold a box of cereal', 'Title: Nope.; Content: Hole is too small and shaped weird - cereal will not come out!!! Mouth Lid flips back down in the way. Lid of entire container harder to snap in place than name brand ones. Spend a little more and get OXO or something similar. These are a waste of money! Too bad I missed the return window. \\U0001f972', 'Title: Product NOT as Advertised; Content: Complaints from family members that have now used this product frequently. Lid not tight enough. Pour spout too small. Not clear enough to see product inside. Tips over easily and with lid not on tight enough quite the mess. Not what I expected. Would like to return if I could.', \"Title: Poor customer service; Content: I purchased this set for cereal and other small dry goods. Unfortunately, the hole to pour out of is useless as everything, even Cheerios, gets stuck. I saw that the manufacturer has a satisfaction guarantee, but after over a week of back and forth emails, they said they can't do anything and to return the product to Amazon. I'm not sure if the larger containers would work better, but wanted other buyers to know before purchasing.\", 'Title: Maybe what you’re looking for?; Content: Looking at the description and the photos I thought the product was going to be a lot larger but honestly it only holds a regular box of cereal and cannot go beyond that. If you were to purchase a value size box or anything larger than 12 ounces then you’re an able to use this product. I have a large family and we buy cereals from the warehouses, I did purchase an OXO that can carry larger oz of cereals.', \"Title: Preferred different style; Content: Returned because I wanted something for large cereal bags, these were maybe for smallest boxes. Didn't feel clip sides were easy... a few tries i got them. Just wasn't for what i need.\", 'Title: Very disappointed; Content: I received the containers today. It looks exactly like the picture but it’s quality is very poor. It was very difficult to close the container. And one side of flip is already broken. Very disappointed. I’ll not recommend it to anyone.', 'Title: Not secure; Content: The mouth is too small, causing a slow pour of whatever is in the container. Also, when you securely close the mouth lid, the container’s lid flap thats right next to the mouth lid pops off. It’s not really secure. I will likely return, but I already put to use 5 containers and threw out the original packaging of that food, so have to wait until less is left. :(', 'Title: Not the size it seems; Content: Lol.....the picture on the product is soooo not realistic. Way smaller than I thought they would be. Are they sturdy? Yes but not big enough to fit an average size box of cereal. Disappointed for sure.', \"Title: Came with a hole; Content: At least 1 container has a hole in it. I haven't checked the others. Will be returning\", 'Title: Find something else.; Content: One lid came broken and another broke within a few days. Quality is bad. You get a lot but wish I would have gotten fewer that work. Cereal is hard to get out without taking lid off.', 'Title: Deceitful photo!; Content: These are cheap plastic translucent containers. They are not clear durable acrylic plastic as shown. Very deceitful photo.', 'Title: not good for pouring; Content: I like the size and how it clips onto the top. However when you fill it with cereal and your trying to pour it, it just bunches up at the hole and you have to scoop it out with your finger or tip it back and forth to get anything out. Wish I would have tried one first instead of filling all of them right away. I would have definitely returned and bought more expensive ones.', 'Title: Too Small; Content: These are NOT the size of a typical cereal keeper. My fork is longer than these containers. I cannot imagine a box of cereal fitting in one of these. They will fit much smaller items like beans/macaroni noodles.', 'Title: Don’t recommend; Content: I wanted to love these, I am very disappointed with the quality. Two of the eight containers were broken when delivered! I would not recommend this and cereal gets stuck, doesn’t pour out as it should.', \"Title: Disappointed; Content: I don't think they should advertise these as cereal containers. A normal box of cereal is about 12 oz. These containers are probably around 10 oz. I'm going to keep them because I'll use them for other things but I'll have to find something else for cereal.\", 'Title: Keep looking!; Content: The hole for pouring does not work! I have tried several types of cereals and none of them pour out. Would not buy again. Not uniform in size, so top takes up a lot of space while bottom is narrow, but a nice fit for gripping.', 'Title: Not for cereal; Content: these containers are to small to hold a regular box of cereal. Great for other things, but NOT cereal', \"Title: Half a box of cereal; Content: They're not as big as I thought. They really only hold about half a bag of cereal. The lids are great quality they really seal on tight. Nice ridges in the back for gripping. The easy for top is awesome. Just wish they were bigger.\", 'Title: Small; Content: These are much smaller then expected. They don’t really fit a entire box of cereal so now I still have boxes of sitting around', 'Title: Missing items; Content: No labels or marker as described only clear containers came with lids', 'Title: Check upon receiving; Content: Recieved product and one of the containers had broke on the edge lip where the lid snaps down so could not use it when I got it. The rest were well dont though.', 'Title: Broken rim but other then that good; Content: Two containers were delivered broken from where the tops closes.... but on the good side of things they still close good and are perfect for the kids treats 👍🏽(Found out they were broken while i was washing them)', 'Title: Much smaller then advertised; Content: I should have read the reviews closer. These are so much smaller then expected. The ounces it says it holds is totally misleading. One of the containers was broken. Wouldn’t buy again', \"Title: Don't seal well; Content: These containers are suppose to be seal proof. Their were ants in my sugar!\", 'Title: Needs a bigger hole; Content: The cereal is hard to pour out. The hole is too small and most cereals get stuck.', 'Title: Wish I had read reviews; Content: These ended up being a lot smaller than I anticipated. They do a good job making them look larger. They will fit a small cereal box. My biggest problem though is if you use it for Life or Cinnamon Toast Crunch they do not pour out of the little hole so my son has to take the lid off completely. This was supposed to make things easier. Going to buy some larger ones with bigger holes for those cereals.', 'Title: SMALL read the measurements AND REVIEWS; Content: Ummm…No way this fits a regular sized cereal box or 85.4oz … I won’t even attempt. They are not even 8in tall. Quality is nice though which is the only reason I give 3 stars. They just should not even mention cereal for these containers. I will be returning, no use for me.', 'Title: Looks can be deceiving; Content: Buyer Beware!! These containers are nice quality but the pictures are really misleading. I assume that these container were see thur acyrilic but instead they are plastic with a frosted clear look. Very disappointed cause they were very expensive. They are also shorter than I anticipated.', \"Title: Decent; Content: These are decent. They seal well enough, and snap to unlock, so that's nice. But the opening doesn't allow for bigger cereals to pour well without getting clogged. Also would be better if the pour opening were flush with the side rather than having a little dam for the last bits of stuff to get caught on. But it depends what you put in it. I've only tried cereal so far.\", 'Title: *Cracked* Not a good design after all; Content: The biggest issue is that one of them came totally cracked. I cannot but any kind of items like sugar or flour in it cause it leaks out the bottom. They are also smaller than expected. I can only fit a small box of cereal in one of them. Which means i am refilling almost every day (That probably is my fault as I didn’t read the measurement) ~~', 'Title: Do the job; Content: I enjoy these containers, But the spout doesn’t always pour very easy, and you have to pay attention to how many ounces it says it is. The ounces are all of the containers added up, so the individual containers are smaller than some containers That are on the market for a comparable prices. However, I do feel like they seal very tightly and do the job.', 'Title: These are NOT as transparent as pictured but good for pantry organization; Content: I used these smaller containers to get rid of the various bags and boxes of food items, NOT bulky items like dog food or cereal, but for nuts, tapioca flour, cornmeal, and other items that I stock in lesser amounts. I would have preferred that they be as transparent as the photos so it makes it easier to see the ingredients at a glance.', \"Title: Came with a broken canister; Content: I really like this brand of containers. They're sturdy, attractive, and stack uniformly in my pantry. This set came with one broken badly enough to make it useless however and I would have to return the entire set if I wanted a replacement for the single broken canister which is more of a hassle than it's worth.\", 'Title: Much smaller than I expected; Content: I ordered these to store pasta/beans/mixed nuts etc. They will not hold spaghetti as they are too short/small. They also will not hold a large box of cereal. I suppose that is my fault - but the photos are misleading.', 'Title: Hole too small for cereal; Content: Hole opening to pour product out of is small and very hard to get cereal out of. Have to take the entire top off to pour out.', 'Title: Nice product but…; Content: Nice product. However, I bought to play cereal and chips in and it ends up that you have to open up the entire top to pour out. I haven’t found anything that actually pours out of the hole on top.', 'Title: Smaller than expected but work well.; Content: On average these containers whole less then your average bag of cereal. The build quality is nice and they seal great and are easy to clean.', 'Title: Good, but doesn’t fit much; Content: I purchased these containers because they were advertised as a cereal container. I didn’t pay much attention to the dimensions when I ordered, but these are much smaller than I anticipated. They only hold about 1/3 a box of cereal. I didn’t think the lids were as secure as soon other brands we owned, so I ultimately returned in favor of a larger and taller container.', 'Title: NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR CEREAL; Content: They take up more space than I thought and can’t hold a box of cereal but they are well made', 'Title: Ok for smaller households; Content: They work, but they do not hold an entire box or bag of anything. Wish they were larger sized.', 'Title: Small than expected; Content: These are smaller than expected so that was a bummer. You have to have a small box of cereal and a kind of cereal that isn’t big pieces for the whole box to fit. What what they are and how much it’s not bad. I’ll need to buy a few larger containers for bigger boxes of cereal.', 'Title: Cereal Containers; Content: Not as big as I thought they would be. They do not fit a full box of cereal.', 'Title: Hands Length.; Content: I’m sure this is a read the fine print but I was expecting full size the sellers pictures are a bit deceptive on size. They do feel very sturdy, nothing was broken when I received my product, just wish they were full size products. Containers are a little bigger than a hands length.', \"Title: Don't buy these to hold spaghetti; Content: Macaroni noodles are fine. Other similar small noodle types are fine too - they aren't tall enough for Spaghetti, or other straight types of noodles. Been coming up with other things to put in them - they are great for protein powder (hell of a lot better than those huge tubs), and spinach in the fridge lasts a couple days longer than it does in the bag. Probably great for oatmeal and other cereal (i don't eat those though), and maybe whole salt/peppercorns (storage for grinders). However, the main reason i got these was to hold straight noodles. I wondered if they would be tall enough, but I guess i should have busted out my tape measure and measured my noodles -_-\", 'Title: Honest review; Content: I was upset that a few of my containers were broken, still happy, but I feel the packaging could be better.. The boxes are smaller in the picture, you cannot fit a family size cereal in these, just so you guys have an idea of the measurements', \"Title: they were smaller than I thought they'd be; Content: These were smaller than I was expecting. But everything else about them was wonderful. Great durability, well crafted. Delivered promptly and I just need to read the descriptions better so I'm not surprised by the size. Even though they were smaller than I'd anticipated I'm still using them nonetheless .\", \"Title: Pretty good; Content: I really like the feel of these- they feel thick and durable. I like that they sent extra labels and a marker, but the marker tends to smudge really easily every time my kids use them. These are a bit smaller than I thought, but a normal box of cereal fits in it. The holes in the top seem big enough but cereal is almost impossible to get to pour out of the hole without assistance. We have Life cereal, Honey Bunches of oats and Cheerios, and I have to stick my fingers inside to help get the cereal to come out. I feel like this could be fixed with some design troubleshooting. Overall they look nice and I like them, but if they could send a marker that's a bit more permanent and fix the top hole, it would be a really great product.\", 'Title: 4 stars; Content: From the photos it looks square but I can put a knorr pasta bag in between with the big gap, not using my space as wisely as I had hoped. I did not care for them at first but they did come in nice shipping box with individual wrapping stacked together. Will buy more in future.', 'Title: Quality containers; Content: These are ideal for storage of flour sugar cereals etc They are well made, strong and quite translucent so that you can see the contents. The only negative are the supplied labels. Even after washing the containers and wiping the surface with 70% isopropyl alcohol the labels do not stick. No matter how hard i press these labels onto the containers they still curl up and eventually fall off.', 'Title: Great for regular boxes of cereal, not family.; Content: These container are very well made BUT i bought them with the intent of putting family size cereal in them. Other reviewers stated they were large enough for a family box cereal and that is not true. You will need 2 containers for 1 box of cereal. I would have purchased different containers if I knew this. Another thing is the hole in which the cereal pours from is very small and makes alot of work out of pouring cereal when it shouldnt be.', \"Title: Really good but...; Content: They're really good but way smaller than expected. Although I have to say that a regular box of cereal actually fits in them. Used for all my pastas, cereal, rice, etc. They seal well too but when pouring out cereal for example it's not smooth. The opening are not spouts.\", \"Title: The containers are great, the labels, ehhh; Content: The containers seem to bee holding up well as are the rubber seals on the lids. The only minor negative is the labels that come with them don't stick very well, especially around the curved edges of the container.\", 'Title: Unsure; Content: I like the way these seal and wash up, but it’s hard to pour the cereal out. I think the holes are to small to pour our a descent amount. My husband hates them.', 'Title: Plastic storage containers; Content: Works for what I wanted to use them for (store noodles). A couple of the containers were broken on arrival. However Amazon as usual took care of the problem.', \"Title: not as big as it looks; Content: I like the look of these storage bins and I've filled them with dry cereal and they seem fine so far. My big word of caution is that they are not as big as they look so check the measurements carefully. They do not hold 85 oz of dry foods. I could fit a 12 oz bag of cereal in one.\", \"Title: Ok; Content: These were smaller than I expected, they're OK for dry ingredient such as sugar, and other things but not great for cereal.\", \"Title: ...; Content: Came with a dark blue chalk marker.

Will not hold a family size box of cereal.', 'Title: Great Value; Content: I bought these as a housewarming gift for my nieces. I thought they were smaller in size if going by the picture on line. I did like the idea of the labels and marking pen that went with them. I gave three stars for each category because I am giving them as a gift.', 'Title: Great containers; Content: I really love them. I purchased 2 sizes, the ones on top are their large 4L (I used them for cereal, granola, oats, and rice) and the ones on the bottom are the 2.5L (I used them for sugar, brown sugar, powder sugar, flour, chia seeds, and cacao) Both sizes are very useful. They came in perfect condition, looks like they will last long. They just look awesome. I should’ve taken a before and after pictures. I still need to add the labels', 'Title: 100% recommended; Content: My nice love them and so do I they are perfect for the cereals but also to store homemade soups on the fridge. It makes it easy to pour a portion on the bowl to reheat in the microwave. Now with the COVID 19 I cook more at home this makes easy to store pourable stuff like soup and creams. Thank you so much I will definitely recommend and buy it again.', \"Title: Air Tight for sure!; Content: You can hear how airtight these containers are... the sound you will recognize . I'm obsessed with containers in the cabinets and pantry right now. It's so nice to have everything in the cabinets and on the shelf organized. It comes with a set of labels and a marker to really put your organization over the top. And I was successful at removing the labels and erasing them with a damp towel, so they can be reused. I use these for granola, oatmeal and Cereal. Also for cookies, Spaghetti, Noodles, and pasta. Lids really seal very well. 4PC Measuring Spoon Set was a nice bonus.\", \"Title: Sturdy and great air tightness; Content: These containers are pretty sturdy and they look durable. The only reason I gave a 3 Star is because I don't know how long they will last (I will update from after 1 year). So far its been 3 months and they have been a champion. They totally close air tight and are nice for the size and to keep dry good organized and in place. It's been good so far.\", \"Title: Great Saving Space; Content: They're small and compact, love how they can fit anywhere in my kitchen and save space/make it easier to organize the pantry! While not as big as the usual containers and might need one and a half to keep free of boxes of cereal, I do prefer these over the big, bulky containers. Edit: They also close very well. I haven't used them for liquids, but my cereal is still crunchy...or maybe we eat it too fast? :-P\", 'Title: Good organizer for my pantry; Content: What I needed to get my pantry in order and uniform. The only thing is you have to hold the lid while pouring dry goods out of them otherwise the top flap will close on you. I like the fact that they are clear, have black labels, and came with the white chalk board marker.', \"Title: Smaller size, perfect for what I needed.; Content: These containers are about 8 inches tall, shorter than most cereal/grain containers I've had before but they are exactly what I needed. They just do hold a 15 oz box of cereal if you tap the canister to help the cereal settle. They have a TIGHT rubber seal around the top. So much so, I struggled getting the lid on a few. They came with labels and a smooth writing white 'chalk' marker. Labels wiped perfectly clean with a clorox wipe.\", 'Title: Great for Storage; Content: If your looking for storage containers for cereal, pasta, bean, etc these containers are perfect. The fasten tight, come with labels and you can stack them... great for counter or pantry.', 'Title: Smaller than pictured; Content: So I ordered these thinking they were large cereal containers. They are NOT. They are short, and I originally planned on sending them back, but have since then used them to store things like sugar, flour, brown sugar, (dry ingredients), but also to organize the fridge. I use them to store 1lb rolls of ground beef, tomatoes or fruits, and other things in the fridge. My favorite feature is that one side has an indent to make it easier to grip.', 'Title: Small but mighty containers; Content: These are smaller than expected but they work nicely and are well made. The lids snap on all 4 sides and there is a circular opening on top to pour out of. Great for organizing my pantry!', 'Title: These are a great size!; Content: This product is great! I have cabinets that are not very deep and these are perfect. For reference, each can hold an entire 12 oz box of cereal perfectly.', 'Title: good seals; Content: nice container but a little smaller than I wanted--does not hold a full bag of cereal-- need to remove about 2 bowls full in order to close top replacing old rubbermaid cereal containers same width but taller a a full bag fit !', 'Title: Loved; Content: I love these they are the best for cereal the kids can’t spill stuff every where the lids are strong and the loom really nice in the cabinets', 'Title: Better than expected; Content: These just have worked out wonderfully. They seal securely and easily and fit in our cabinet configuration nearly perfectly. Very pleased.', 'Title: Just what I need; Content: Storage containers are awesome. I have a lot of coffee whole beans. We grind coffee every day so these are right for keeping the beans fresh', 'Title: Great buy!; Content: They are tiny, about double the hand size going sideways. But!! They did help keep organized in the kitchen! Only issue is some cereal is hard to get out because of their shape but if you just shake it’ll be fine! Helps with not over pouring!', 'Title: Amazing Storage; Content: These storage containers are amazing. The lids seal great and keep things fresh. Highly recommend.', 'Title: Very nice; Content: Very nice, easy to use, stackable. I use them for cereal. They look good sacked on the countertop and they are easy for my kids to poor out the cereal. Fits 1 box of cereal, I use multiple for the bags of cereal.', \"Title: Looked very expensive for budget price; Content: These are so cute. These are very nice n such a bargain,didn't look cheap in the least. Nice n stirdy. They were well packaged to say it was silverware. The box came wrapped in bubble wrap, which my grandkids n I loved because we love to pop. Opening the packages made their day, it was like Xmas.\", \"Title: JUST BUY IT; Content: It was cheap. I didn't expect it to be so.........NICE!! They are heavy and packaged really well. That being said...be prepared to recycle ALL the packaging. LOL Each piece is wrapped itself. This would make an AMAZING gift!!\", \"Title: Rarely give 5 stars; Content: I bought these for the harvest right freeze dryer, medium. The trays on that site are $69, so I was looking for something more affordable. These trays are heavy, just as the others and they are stainless, not aluminum, which is important to me. Two of these trays matches the one medium size of the other. And here's the deal, when freeze drying, it's important to not have one solid mass of product, freezing on these, then putting on the reg tray breaks up the solid mass. We also put two trays in the FD instead of one sometimes. They fit. They work. And I'm going to buy another set. 1. because they are smaller and fit in more small, FULL freezer places, to freeze the food. and 2. they are WAY more affordable.\", 'Title: Containers for storage; Content: Lids it to tight!', 'Title: Great purchase....the little one does not close!!; Content: The only reason I did not give them 5 star was because the smallest container does not close very well. I have tried everything to get it to close. I love the containers!!! I just wish the little one was working!!!', 'Title: Good purchase; Content: I have had these for 49 days now and they are great. The tops were an added bonus for me and they work great. They are easy to clean and nest inside one another.', 'Title: Garbage.; Content: One of my cereal containers is missing a rubber valve and it causes the container to stay open and our cereal go stale. I would buy from somewhere else. I paid $25 for 3 containers basically.', 'Title: Don’t waste your money.; Content: Really wanted to like these but they are terrible. They do not keep cereal fresh. And when you go to pour it out the spout gets clogged so easily. Don’t waste your money.', 'Title: Only got 4 out of the 5 containers; Content: This product was supposed to come with 5 containers I only received 4! And the lids are super difficult to close.. annoying', 'Title: Do not purchase; Content: These smell so strong of plastic and after washing these three times before use, the smell wouldn’t go away. Ruined the cereal I put in them and gave it a bad taste.', 'Title: Markings are in fluid ounces.; Content: The markings and description say 135 oz. so though wow sweet these will fit those ginormous bags of cereal that clutter up my pantry. Nope. The markings are in fluid oz for dry storage. Not helpful. 42 oz of dry cereal is much bulkier than the same amount of liquid. They’re nice containers, just understand they’re smaller than they seem.', 'Title: Pretty but not really functional; Content: I had high hopes for these containers but they are not working out as well as I thought they would. They are hard to seal on, it’s almost as if the lid is too small. Also, when I pour cereal or snacks out, it is hard for the food to come out and hard to control the amount that comes out. It also leaves residue and crumbs on the small lid before I close it which is annoying. I have two starts since they look pretty but not super functional.', 'Title: Dispensing hole is too small; Content: The hole is too small. I got this for cereals and the only one I can shake out is Cheerios. Anything else gets stuck, and I need to take the whole lid off. It really defeats the purpose.', 'Title: Cute with Flaws; Content: So sad when tried to closed the lid on container! Lids are too small. Love the labels tho. Wanted so bad to keep them, I did have to return the package.', 'Title: Four out of five usable equals two out of five stars.; Content: I have four usable containers and one with an incomplete lid-the flip top is missing. To box all five up and ship them back for replacement seems excessive. The ones that work seem sturdy enough and will do what I need them to do, but the lids can be a little tricky to secure if you don’t get the lid positioned on the container just right. I wish I’d bought the ones I saw in target a few months ago.', 'Title: Broken; Content: They came stacked in each other. The bottom of one was completely cracked unuseable. Smaller than i imagined but holds 12oz box of cereal with room to spare.', \"Title: Don't look same what we see here; Content: This container are good but giving less star bcoz they look completely different what they show here once you change pic n also rather than putting oz should put in lbs\", 'Title: Kitchen item; Content: I thought they were a little bigger than they were but they have worked out very well. They bring warmth to my kitchen with the little tags. Very well made.', 'Title: not durable.; Content: good size container and lid but not durable. first day one fell to the floor and cracked and no longer can be used. for the price i’ve seen more durable containers.', \"Title: Not ideal for pouring cereal; Content: These containers are build well and lock nicely... BUT Not ideal if you plan on using for cereal. The opening is too small and my cereal won't pour out (lucky charms or cinnamon toast crunch). They are also bulky\", 'Title: one of the lid was short did not receive; Content: one little problem one lid was short and i need bigger size thank you', \"Title: Broken containers, refurbished item sold as new, no marker or labels.; Content: Three of the containers came with broken lips, like pictured. The shipping box was not damaged. I also didn't receive the marker or labels. The product came as a refurbished item, though that's not what I ordered. Giving two stars for the two containers that are not damaged.\", 'Title: Look different than advertising; Content: I am very disappointed with the look of the containers. In tge pictures thry look acrylic but are instead cheap plastic. I would not recommend these if you are looking for something sleek looking.', 'Title: Free Chalk Labels and Pens MISSING; Content: Containers themselves seem sturdy enough but I am missing the 20 “FREE” chalk labels and white chalk pen that was supposed to come with them which is the only reason I went with this seller in the first place. Not sure how to contact them and ask for the labels and pen to be sent as the only option seems to be to ask for a refund.', 'Title: It’s not as sturdy.; Content: There is broken part near the opening on one of the containers. The others three are okay.', 'Title: Opening too small; Content: My main problem with these is that the mouth is really small, so most of my cerals except Cheerios bunch up and I have to open the entire top to get a pour going.', 'Title: Received defective container.; Content: Fast shipping, i am bummed as one of the containers will not shut. All the others seems to be ok. Unfortunately, i found this as I was almost done filling them. The ones that do close are very nice but I got a defective one. I tried contacting the seller and did not receive a response. I would like for the one to be replaced. I do not need a whole new set. Can someone respond to my email?', \"Title: Look nice, air tight, impossible to pour from the lid.; Content: These are OK. Definitely is a nice air tight seal. I bought these for cereal containers and they do hold a good amount of cereal. But, the pop open lid doesn't really allow you to pour out the contents. I have another brand I use for backing supplies that works great with pouring, so I'll either swap them, or just buy more of those. Taking the whole lid off every time you want something is just a bit too annoying.\", \"Title: very sturdy and air-tight, but the mouth is not large enough for most cereal; Content: bought these for storing cereal. The containers themselves are well made and have a fantastic seal. The issue I have is that the mouth of the lid is too small and cereal doesn't easily pour out. This is true for small cereal like lucky charms, but even worse with something like shredded wheat. Might work great for small grains like rice or beans or something, but doesn't work as good for cereal.\", 'Title: Ok for the money; Content: Good product. I thought they would be taller and thinner but serve their purpose well. One of the canisters was cracked on the bottom upon opening the box. Could not figure out how to contact the seller. I did not want to return the whole thing for one cracked container.', 'Title: Broken lid; Content: Loved the product. Unfortunately, one lid was broken. I didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning everything. I called to asked for one lid to be sent to me (I would have paid for it) but they couldn’t do that. So I’m unable to use one of the containers.', \"Title: Just recieved; Content: One of the containers came broken on the bottom. The others look fine. I haven't used them yet. Just recieved today.\", 'Title: False advertising - not air right; Content: Not even remotely airtight. Blatant false advertising on that point. The plastic is thin and flimsy, so when you pick the bin up, it compresses and the air squeezes right out through the “seals.”', 'Title: Not good for pouring things out of; Content: Really hard to poor anything from this container', 'Title: Size; Content: Week not hold a large box of cereal', 'Title: Small opening; Content: Returned product. Hard to pour cereal or pasta out', 'Title: Disappointed in size; Content: These are fantastically made containers but I’m disappointed. I always review everything to death but I didn’t on these, I wish I did. We are a family of six, and I need two of these containers to fit the medium size bags of cereal. Definitely won’t fit a big box. Gonna have to look for bigger and use these for pancake mix and such.', \"Title: Good value but didn't meet all my expectations.; Content: These are the containers that I had the correct height for on my pantry shelf. They will only hold a regular box or bag. When I received them I was disappointed that they were not as clear as depicted and the bases are smaller and rounded so they cannot be stacked side by side tightly.\", 'Title: Great containers!; Content: I used this for all types of food storage. From cereal, to flour to rice. It seals well. It is airtight as long as you close it correctly. I love how it has the black label and white market to correctly label each container.', \"Title: I'd buy that again; Content: These containers are amazing! Love their durability against a 4 year old and very aggressive cats. Sturdy enough for decorations, and other like containers to be placed on top of.\", \"Title: Ok Containers, Useless Labels; Content: Containers are fine and lids feel secure but labels are useless when the company provides a blue pen. You can't read the label with blue ink on a black background.\", 'Title: Not for family size cereal boxes; Content: Will fit an average size cereal box but not big enough for the larger family size cereal boxes.', 'Title: Mostly love these.; Content: They look cool. Have a good seal. My husband wishes the opening for pouring would be larger.', 'Title: Keeps cereal crispy-fresh; Content: Keeps cereal crispy even in humid weather. A little cumbersome to get lids on and off but the seals are well designed and keep things dry and fresh.', \"Title: Cool product; Content: Great looking containers. Easy to open. Easy to pour. We'll see how long thr cereal lasts.\", 'Title: Great, but difficult to pour; Content: I bought with for cereals, but the holes are really too small for cereals larger than Cheerios.', 'Title: Great storage; Content: Always looking to buy something for my cereals. This was on sale and you get 5 which was a great deal. I definitely recommend this.', 'Title: Nice fit; Content: These are great containers but the stickers that it comes with are not high quality. I like the containers but would not rate them any better than those you can buy from a local container store, Walmart or target. I would definitely recommend these.', 'Title: Buyer beware; Content: one container lid had a broken slap and a containers are very small in comparison to what you can buy at Walmart', 'Title: Needs smoother pouring; Content: Enjoying storage only issue is it is a little difficult to pour cereal smoothly out.', 'Title: great quality; Content: Great containers but 1/5 was cracked upon arrival. I needed them ASAP so didnt send back', 'Title: Great item; Content: Love it. My only issue is that it can be hard for the cereal to pour out at times. The hole isn’t big enough.', 'Title: Love love love these!; Content: I was in search of some containers that would keep our cereal fresh and keep tje sugar ants out. I looked into the OXO brand but was not willing to pay the hefty price. I had some OXO push pop containers a while back and the lids would slowly slide off when you held the container by the lid (no bueno for what they cost). I wanted something affordable that would make my pantry look organized and pretty and came across these containers. I decided to give them a try and Im so glad i did. The lids snap close and the opening to pour cereal onto your bowl is sealed tightly (you have to use a little force to open it). Our cereal has stayed fresh and i love that im able to see when we are running low. I have been very satisfied with this purchase', 'Title: The perfect size for cereal; Content: It took me forever to finally pick these. I wanted to make sure they were big enough to fit cereal in them, and more than one box at a time. Your average size cereal box will fit in here filling it up about 3/4 of the way. The family size will fill it up perfectly. But then you have cereals like honey bunches of oats that come in pretty skinny boxes. It took 2 of those to fill up a container. These came with labels and the chalk marker. I think that part made me the happiest. My chalk markers were all dried out and the one that came in the set wrote perfectly and dried really fast. These sealed completely on all 4 sides and snapped down easily. The spout seals nicely also and is easy to open. Depending on the size of the cereal will determine how easily your cereal is going to pour out. Trix poured out nicely but the Chex mix was a struggle. They kept blocking the hole and getting stuck so I had to shake and pour, worked like a charm. I am very happy with these. I would recommend them.', \"Title: Great containers, they are good quality and you get a decent amount of them.; Content: I bought these to keep pantry moths out of my cereal while I battle for ownership of my house with them, it looks like these are going to do the trick. The seals are real snug it's definitely air tight and it's not difficult to open the pour spout but it definitely takes some pressure so it seals good aswell. I was able to fit a whole brand new box of Honeycomb cereal in one so it's capable of holding any average size box of cereal no problem. The plastic isn't super rigid it has some bend but doesn't feel super cheap it also has a nice clean look. For the price this is a really good amount of a really decent product.\", 'Title: Large family approved!; Content: I am beyond pleased with these containers! We are a family of 6, with 4 of those being children so we buy a lot of cereal in massive boxes. As you can see in my photos a big family size box fits perfectly into these containers without the container being nearly as bulky as the boxes. They’ve freed up so much space in my pantry! They’re also too difficult to open for me to worry about my preschoolers dumping them everywhere.', 'Title: I absolutely love these containers; Content: I have purchase a few different storage containers in my day but was looking for ones specifically for cereal and came across these, and they work better than i thought they would have to be honest, the latch and seal around the top of the container really are air tight along with another set i recently purchased i filled these up with some water to test them as i was rinsing them out for the first time and they held water, the other amazing thing is the lid on top for pouring the cereal out of is just as tight and well fitted as the main seal, the little raised latch is also a nice feature i was worried that if i hit these just right a container would just pop open but that is not the case, overall i would highly recommend these storage containers they work wonderfully and come as advertised, they will fit most family sized boxes of cereal, but good luck if you buy the bags, dont think you will get even 3/4 of that in one of these, also if it is bigger like mini wheats they will not fit either so you have to buy the smaller boxes.', 'Title: Works great; Content: At first, I was kind of hesistant to like this product. It is difficult to get it closed and to open it. I have to do it for my 6 year old. BUT it has kept the mice out (we live in the country and despite 2 cats, we still have to deal with the occasional mouse in the home). It has also kept the bugs out (again country life.) it’s an air tight seal so you no longer have to worry about stale cereal because one of your house people didn’t roll up the bag and close the box. The size is great. It fits a family box of cereal just fine if not stopping right at the top. The Costco boxes seem to be a bit too big because you can’t fit all of that cereal nicely into one of these. It also looks a lot neater having these vs a bunch of random opened cereal boxes crowding your counter top.', 'Title: Love it.; Content: Love these bins! Bought several of them to completely reorganize my pantry. They stack nicely and it’s super easy to see what’s in them. My only two complaints are the seals on the cereal pour spouts are easily plugged with cereal, especially if you use a smaller cereal, such as granolas. It works great for flakey type cereals and they don’t tend to get plugged. For my granola, I just open the lid instead. My other complaint is that there is a lot of wasted space. If the edges of the containers were more square, you could fit more. I’m have more space than before, so this is somewhat of a moot point, but I would still like to see a better use of space. Overall, I love them and will be ordering more.', 'Title: Protect your food; Content: I recently got a bad problem with moths ! I had to throw out runs off food! I ordered these for everything that can be opened from rice to cereal to bird food! It was kind of expensive but no more moths! And who knows how many we ate ! I was grossed out! No more worries!', 'Title: Super Convenient, Keeps cereal way fresher than the bag; Content: I really like the how these keep cereal fresh. I don’t eat cereal often so it often goes stale in the bag in my pantry for weeks. These are way easier to pour and put away than trying to use bag clips. They fit a whole bag of the big boxes of cereal from the store. The spout is a little to small for cereals like Cinnamon toast crunch that gets stuck, but otherwise works great. I found the stickers kind of pointless because everyone knows what cereal looks like.', \"Title: Airtight as advertised!; Content: I've used this for a little over a month now and has been pleased with the product, it's airtight as advertised, which is the most important, and has maintained freshness of all my cereal products. Not sure why they're advertised as stackable, they're really not. They came packaged well and no damages whatsoever. I agree that the blue pen dosen't really work well, could hardly read it against the black labels. I think it would've been better off with white pen, but that's a minor issue.\", 'Title: Happy so far!; Content: Bought to store cereals for freshness and easy access. Seem to seal well and pour spout lids close tightly. Happy so far! Will have to wait to see about durability and freshness, but they seem tough enough after already being dropped and beat up a little by some curious cats.', 'Title: Good buy; Content: Good buy. It checks off all the boxes for freshness, size, easy to operate, sturdy plastic, keeps sugar ants out. I don’t use the labels because it’s easy to see what is in there, and the contents change too frequently. Size is good for the kids to handle them by themselves, and fits all of our cereal/snack needs.', 'Title: Child friendly; Content: Bought these to make fixing cereal for my 9 year old easier. She loves these. They fit on the lower shelves in my pantry unlike regular cereal boxes and she can pour cereal easily without making a mess. They keep the cereal fresh as well. Easy clean up tip I put the entire bag of cereal down in the container instead of pouring it in.', 'Title: A year later…still great!; Content: I’ve had these containers for over a year and they have held up great. They’ve only gone through the dishwasher a few times. We normally just rinse them out, dry and add new cereal. For the most part, every BOX of cereal I buy, fits in the container. Big bags of cereal do not always all fit. They have a nice seal and keep everything fresh.', 'Title: Great for cereal and grain storage.; Content: So far I have used them for cereal and granola storage and with the flip top it makes very easy to pour the items out, just what I purchased them for. They seem to be sturdy and seal nicely, so if you have any problems with insect or small rodents, they should be a good barrier to keep them out. I have not had them long, so I cannot provide any info on longevity.', 'Title: Perfect for getting pantry organized; Content: Ordered these containers to help get our pantry organized and they are the perfect size. They fit so well on the shelves. Cereals stay fresh, and I love that come with a measuring set and little chalk pen and stickers to label everything. Very happy', 'Title: Perfect air tight organizing for your messy pantry!; Content: My pantry was a disaster! These containers are not only the perfect height and width for my shelves, they are superior in quality and provide a nice air tight lock for your food. Wildone also gives you a nice white marker pen and a generous amount of labels, for when you decide to replace the Cherrios with Basmati Rice. You can even wipe the labels with a wet paper towel and reuse them. Bonus! The measuring cups are a fabulous bonus!', 'Title: Love these!; Content: I bought these to store my flours. For a reference, they fit my Anthony’s coconut flour 4 pounds plus could fit more as you can see in pic. You can always press down to make more fit. Just depends on what flour you’re using. Definitely recommend and will buy more', \"Title: These seal so well that I can barely get it open; Content: These do EXACTLY what they're intended for; to keep the product inside fresh. We LOVE these, great for cereal, cookies and crackers! Oh and the amount of labels that come are more than enough for when you need to change them out!\", 'Title: Perfect for the job; Content: I needed to reorganize my kitchen cupboards from round containers that were not space effective to square and rectangle containers that could be stacked and would take up less room. The Wildone 5 Pieces Airtight Cereal Storage Containers were perfect for what I needed.', 'Title: Perfect!; Content: The shipping was really fast, it arrived on time and I was really surprised at how easy they were to clean. You can read the measurements very easy and I am really happy that they have multiple measurements as it helps out with baking season! I would definitely recommend!', 'Title: Cheap; Content: There must be tiny pun holes. You put liquid in these and they leak!', 'Title: Good for the price; Content: I loved them. I used them to storage fruits and vegetables. It makes my food stay fresh!', 'Title: Everything needed in one place; Content: Mix store and serve and in the same container. I love it. I appreciate that all the bpa free plastic is different colors. So I can easily remember. What goes with which and not mix up the sizes of ingredients going into my masterpieces! Easy to clean. Easy to store Nd no worries of breakage and glass', 'Title: Disappointed; Content: Did not receive what the picture and box show. I received all the same size containers.', 'Title: I’m very disappointed! I received a box full of the same size containers!; Content: If i could give it zero-stars I would! I received it a little while ago(I hadn’t had a chance to open it yet) but i did this morning and I’m very disappointed! All of the containers are the same size! It’s past the return date so i basically got screwed out of my money and have little containers i have no use for. I received 25 piece with the smallest container size. I’m so disappointed.', 'Title: Not what I expected; Content: I expected alot more quality for this product. I was expecting a higher quality plastic/acrylic. These are just thicker plastic containers with lids for the price I paid. Inhave no idea how the actual airtight quality is. But I guess I will find out.', 'Title: Decent; Content: They’re kind of made out of cheap plastic I mean they are air ties and they have the labels to put on. But they’re not the size that I kind of expected them to be about it we’re going to be larger but they’re pretty small. The large boxes about 12 inches or so and then it just goes down from there. Before before opening one they look all like they are the same size. So like you’ll have to open it to see the sizes. But I ordered another one just in case it’s a little more expensive but maybe it would be a better quality and may be bigger size', 'Title: Multi-purpose, indispensable set; Content: Great set for keeping my baking staples organized. They are easy to open and close and most importantly airtight. Good number of containers with labels, I haven’t even filled them all yet. Love this set and it makes baking day even more enjoyable!', 'Title: Great storage; Content: I have ordered several sets of these in an effort to have more container that are well sealed.

Ants still got into one of the semi-sweet food items. I live in the tropics so ants are part of daily life here. It is simply not airtight at all. First review: Ants got in.

Have had these for only a few months but am past the return window or I would definitely be returning these. As you can see in the pictures these are not airtight- we got bugs inside of them! 🤢 Do not recommend. Hopefully I can get in touch of the company and get a refund!', 'Title: Not air tight; Content: Sent back because they are not air tight. Filled with water and turned over and the water runs right out.', \"Title: Pretty disappointed; Content: Was very sad these didn't clean well as far as the rubber washer. I took them off to clean before using and when i dried them, they wouldnt seal anymore. They dragged. Its a nice idea for what they are supposed to do, but they did not perform.\", 'Title: Not worth your money; Content: Anything in powder gets very hard. Lids easily come off with out taking latch off very cheap never buying again', 'Title: Disappointed; Content: I was very disappointed. The containers were way smaller than what i thought. Way to small!!!', 'Title: Do not buy.; Content: Not airtight. You can just pull the lid off when it’s supposed to be locked closed. Returning tomorrow.', 'Title: Cracked after 1 drop.; Content: After 1 drop the container cracked and this is 3 containers I have to throw away. I use this for kids snacks because it’s easy for them to open and closed. When washing the lids it hold water after being handwashed. You have to shake the water out and then let it air dry for a couple days before using it for food. Now I found new containers that’s durable for kids.', \"Title: Not impressed....; Content: Not that impressed. Plastic is very thin, if it is accidentally dropped on the floor they will shatter. Also, the sizes are a lot smaller than i expected. A bag of sugar or flour wouldn't fit in any of them. Keeping only because its too much trouble to rewrap, package back up and return..\", 'Title: Just okay; Content: Not airtight and you can pull the lids off without releasing the latch - but okay for basic pantry items if you aren’t concerned about it not being airtight', 'Title: Not air tight .... more like air tightesh; Content: Not really air tight does have a seal but def not air tight. They are clean looking on my counter', 'Title: Not Airtight; Content: These are NOT airtight at all! Lids pop off extremely easily! There Useless for me if there not airtight! Description is inaccurate!', 'Title: Too small; Content: Nice containers but they are so small I am having a hard time finding a use for them. Wish they had a full set of the tall container size mixed with even larger pieces.', 'Title: There are better options; Content: The top of one of the containers broke before I put it on the first time.', 'Title: Damaged upon arrival; Content: Items arrived with box in tact but the two medium containers are damaged with very visible scratches. This was a gift so it’s disappointing.', \"Title: Great packaging. Not so functional seal; Content: It came with great packaging both bubble wrap and in one of the most sturdiest boxes I have seen. Everything seemed of quality when I removed the containers from the bubble wrap and washed it before use. It was not until I put honey oatmeal squares in one of the containers did I encounter an issue. For it to be airtight and sealed I should not have been able to smell the cereal from outside the container, yet I did. We have an ant issue from the summer heat and neighbors moving out removing their source of food from them to us, causing me to purchase these containers. They aren't as air tight or scent tight as I had hoped thus making it not a great value for what you pay for. If what you store inside is not sweet or a concern this is a decent deal. Another note worth mentioning is when you wash the lids water gets trapped inside a hollow space inside, the mechanism that allows the container to seal and unseal with the lever. Allocating some funds to aid in bettering the seal would help.\", \"Title: Containers; Content: These are okay, would like for the tops to fit more snug, they don't seem to be air tight.\", 'Title: Baking goods; Content: Got for pantry storage. They were smaller then though would be. One came broken. So used for baking goods to keep good.', 'Title: Not completely air tight.; Content: Not quite as big as I expected. Also you can pull the \"air tight\" lids off after locking them. I put a graham cracker in one over night and it was soft the next morning.', 'Title: Keeps pantry bugs out! gets the job done!; Content: Gets the job done! Good Quality, could use a stronger suction seal', 'Title: Really good storage containers; Content: I love that this set has a variety of sizes, I used them for coffee, beans and ground herb storage. Just what I needed at a good price. The quality of the containers is really good too. The only hassle is when you wash the lid the water takes forever to drain from inside it, but otherwise no complaints, they stack pretty well in my pantry.', \"Title: I'd buy more again; Content: I've bought 2 packs 6 now because for the price you can't beat it. So far I've had 2 almost look like they stress fracture on them if they're not sealed correctly. But I really like them and they're better than spending $100 on 3 name brand ones lol\", 'Title: Good Containers; Content: The containers arrived sooner than I thought. The suction is very good. It helped me arrange my pantry a bit.', 'Title: Great containers; Content: Smaller than I thought they would be but they work great on my sugar, pasta, flour, etc.', 'Title: airtight maybe; Content: You have to make sure you close these properly sometime it does not form an airtight seal, but they look very nice on the counter.', \"Title: Very good value, but not the greatest containers; Content: They're very skinny, which can be good and bad. My biggest complaint with these is with how thick the lid is and how far down inside the container it goes; on the smaller containers, you can only fill them like 2/3 because the lid is so big and solid, it goes down in and takes up the the other 3rd. Otherwise, these seem quite sturdy, though I haven't dropped one yet. The locking/unlocking flip on the top goes either way and operates VERY smoothly. Definitely creates an airtight seal. For the price, I'm 110% satisfied.\", 'Title: They’re ok, but small don’t hold as much as I’d like So far they’re working; Content: Though they can very well packaged, I wasn’t wowed by them. They are smaller Han I expected & I’m not impressed with their durability, though i haven’t cracked any yet, I’m careful what I store in them. They seem to work well for my usage for angel hair pasta, cookies, etc. they work for those items as they are small & by the time the lid is locked down they don’t hold a lot. I thought they would be similar to another brand I have, they are not. I don’t know if I would gift them, guess it would depend on who the gift was for to be honest. I’ll try to get photos up when I find them', \"Title: Perfect to organize your life!; Content: Perfect for pantry organization! Durable, air-tight for preserving freshness. Crystal clear containers so there is no mistaking what's inside. Perfect stacking ability for space saving! I could not have purchased a better product for my pantry!

I will be purchasing more of these!\", \"Title: Very snug and easy to open; Content: I bought these for my RV and then I bought some more for my house! I love the way they close -- stay shut and air-free, but they are also easy to open. I like the little labels that come with it, but the white marker smears if you don't let it dry -- fyi. Great product!!\", 'Title: Love these!; Content: In love with these. Will be getting more to stare all my dry goods. Beans, nuts, grains...all. love the way the lids work.

They are a great quality. I love that they come in a range of sizes and also have labels. Will definitely be ordering more to continue organizing in my kitchen.', 'Title: Perfect; Content: Glad I read the reviews! I wanted storage containers that were hard plastic but clear. These are really nice. The only complaint I have is small and that is I wish it came with 2 large instead of just one.', \"Title: Best Price; Content: There were plenty of these containers on Amazon, but I was looking for the best deal. They work and look great. I'm going to order a couple more sets...one for my daughter and another one for me.\", 'Title: Perfect for kitchen organization!; Content: I used these containers to organize my baking items, along with another set I got on Amazon. My baking section looks so much better now that it’s cute and organized! Would highly recommend these to spruce up your pantry while keeping things fresh.', 'Title: Perfect size for my camper slideout storage; Content: these containers are durable and pest proof for use in my camper.

Thanks', 'Title: Buy. You won’t regret it; Content: Love these containers I wish I purchase more I had a discount code so I was willing to try them but they are spectacular', 'Title: Damaged container mouths; Content: Two pieces in the box arrived broken on the side where the lids lock. This resulted in these two containers not getting locked , doesn’t close air tight', 'Title: Pay attention to sizes; Content: I liked everything but the sizes. They were small and there is no cereal container in this set.', \"Title: Cloudy, not clear as in pics. You can't see food as well as expected.; Content: Keeps out pantry moths and keeps food fresher. Great organization. I like the pourable opening and they come with plenty of labels.\", 'Title: Not clear like pictured; Content: Nice for affordable storage. Labels look nice on the containers. They are, however, not clear like the picture shows. They seem sturdy. The outside latches for the lids don’t allow them to sit flush together, so that’s a bit of a downside, but for the price they work.', \"Title: Didn't get this order.; Content: In the photos, it shows you get some tall containers.

Photos do not match product sent!; Content: The containers received are frosted plastic that have flexibility to them, not at all like the rigid clear containers pictured in the listing.', \"Title: There not as big as I thought they would be; Content: The big ones don't even hold a whole box of cereal there ok for now also there no wider then a pop tart box like the small boxes just FYI they will be ok until I can afford bigger ones grate for snacks a hole box of cheeses it's fit in the big ones hope this help\", 'Title: Sturdy Containers; Content: These containers make organizing your pantry quickly and efficiently. The snap lids are sturdy and don’t feel like they will fall apart easily. This is the second set I’ve purchased from this seller. They arrived within a few days of ordering and are packaged securely.', 'Title: Great!; Content: I love the variety in the sizes. At some point I was not sure what else to add in them. These are perfect for both fridge and pantry. Awesome price too!', 'Title: All containers were the same size; Content: All containers were the same size and no chalk pen or labels were included. Pretty useless.', 'Title: Same size; Content: Our containers where the same size', \"Title: Nice addition to the pantry; Content: It organized my noodles, baking stuff, and grains. It's nice the lids are interchangeable, however, the taller containers are really skinny so it tips over easily. Labels are nice.\", 'Title: Thase are great; Content: So I initially opened the box and it is deceiving before you remove them from the plastic. It appears that all the containers are small until you pull them all out and apart. But these are great!!!! Im glad I am too lazy to send stuff back and actually took the time to separate these. So if you see other reviews stating they received all the same size containers they may have done what I did and jumped the gun on leaving a review.', 'Title: Mine arrived with one of the quart sized containers broken. Can I somehow get a replacement?; Content: I used this product for flours, snacks, and other items I wanted to keep dry. I’m happy with them except for the broken one.', 'Title: Okay!; Content: The size is not what I expected. The boxes are okay and works fine. Good for storing food but does not fit much. Containers are air tight. Happy with the purchase.', 'Title: Best thing in my kitchen!; Content: I have these shelves in my kitchen and things seem to accumulate there like crazy. I bought these and presto! Clutter free super organized and just a sleek nice look. I already ordered my second set to continue on my organization venture!', 'Title: Great product; Content: I love the containers and I love the fact that they give you labels.', 'Title: Functionality; Content: Closely comparable to \" chefs path\" brand for $20.00 less. Save your money and get this set.It is just as good with same size and amount of containers.even the lids are interchangable', \"Title: Sturdy; Content: My pantry looks perfect.. they're really good storages\", 'Title: Too many for one kitchen; Content: Rice & flour.', 'Title: Steal of a deal!; Content: I live in Hawaii and we get ants if anything is left open or out and these containers work GREAT to keep those tiny boogers out! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the labels that came with the product, they have a cute doted boarder and the chalkboard marker that comes with works great. I also like that you can easily remove AND reuse these stickers, just take a paper towel with a skosh of isopropyl alcohol, wipe, and rename. Only downfall is that after washing, the area between the plastic lid and the rubber seal does not dry very well and I had to forcefully tap the inside middle of the lid to be able to remove the rubber seal and completely dry out this space.', 'Title: seal good, nice size; Content: i like the size and shape. the lids have a removable seal in them that can be washed. four sided locks on lids. nice looking label. full bag of flour in the big with extra room and sugar in the small likewise. i have a couple small complaints.1: one of mine had a damaged internal lip on the seal ring of the lid that makes it hard to put the lid on. 2: i lifted the flour with one hand and when the snap from that side popped off, so did the rest and i dropped it. i now know to use two hands.', 'Title: Pretty good; Content: These are pretty large and good storage containers overall . My only issue is that you have to be careful when pulling them off the shelf because they lids can come loose if you accidentally grab the lip by accident. This is particular the case if it’s on a bottom shelf and the storage container is heavy. I suppose that’s just common sense though LOL!', 'Title: Great for the price; Content: They are sturdy enough but they do have a little bit of give (like better quality Tupperware) it’s not hard plastic. I would recommend using both hands to grab a container if you have something heavier like flour in it. From the product pictures they look like they are clear plastic. I should have looked at review pictures cause they are actually very slightly frosted. It’s bot a big enough deal for me, but it does cheapen the look a bit. All in all it’s a good deal for the price considering that you would be paying the same price for only one fancier looking one. They might not look as nice as expected, but they saved my budget and keep things neat and organized.', 'Title: Great for storage; Content: I needed some containers to store my dry pantry products. Works great for sugar, flour, oats, ect. Love the labels too. If you need to change the name, just use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and wipe off, dry, then write', 'Title: Airtight; Content: They are very airtight, can hearing the air going in when opened. Got them cleaned and filled with Flour, sugar, brown sugar and salt.

I have stacked them so that I can see all the labels they came with. Just what my kitchen was missing', 'Title: Perfect Size!; Content: Before ordering, I was nervous that the containers would be too small to fit a bag of cereal, the entire flour bag, etc. But when I got them in yesterday and began to fill them, I noticed I may need smaller ones now LOL. They are the perfect size! The largest container fit a huge bag of dried oats, the smaller container fit a bag of flour! I was shocked! Definitely will be ordering again. The material is 10/10 too.', 'Title: You must have it in your kitchen.; Content: I like this product its beautiful size and it sealed very well. It had two different size four big ones and four medium size. I recommend it to everyone.', 'Title: Very quick and helpful customer service; Content: I had a problem with 1 of the containers and I emailed the company directly. I got a very quick response , within 24 hours to my initial email. The customer service I received was very good and helpful. I have now bought a total of 3 sets, all different, from this company and can say that I am very pleased with the price, quality and customer service received. I will definitely be getting more storage containers from them as needed, maybe even for my kids for Christmas gifts.', 'Title: She Loves These Storage Containers; Content: Just days after Christmas, my daughter washed and began using these containers. She loved them so much, I ordered another set for her. They were a big hit. Now, she\\'s suggesting I get some for myself instead of the \"mix-match containers I\\'ve been using. I think she\\'s right!', 'Title: Purchased 3 separate times! So good!; Content: Purchased one set to try them out, and was so impressed I purchased two more sets! Bugs are an issue in Florida, so I needed sturdy airtight containers for my pantry items. These absolutely do not disappoint. Two different sizes for versatility, and the labels make it easy to quickly determine bread flour versus all-purpose flour for example. Tops lock on tight (just be sure to line them up properly before trying to lock the \"flaps\" down). They\\'ve been through the dishwasher with zero issues. I\\'ve been using the first set for a year with daily use and they are still in perfect condition, proving sturdiness. Far superior to the other brand I tried. I will continue to purchase this brand if my storage needs increase, but for now my pantry is organized, easy to see what\\'s what, and free from creepy crawlies. Win win win!!', \"Title: Great for the price; Content: There are thicker plastic containers on the market but there is also much thinner ones also. They will do nicely and last a long time with proper care. Remember the lids have a removable seal. Knowing that will help with cleaning and drying them. I used 3 of the biggest for plastic cutlery. They will hold 100 of each: forks, spoons and knives. They come with chalkboard stickers and a marker. I used the stickers but not the marker. A big one will hold 16 boil-in-bag rice bags. I haven't used any of the smaller ones yet. I would estimate they would probably hold about 6 to 8 sticks of butter. But I can't say that for certain because I have not used them yet.\", \"Title: Nice Sturdy Containers; Content: I ordered 2 sets and reorganized my cabinets. I kept seeing people complain about separating them from each other for the first time. My advice, put on the side and pull one side, turn to next side and pull and keep going around. I put a little muscle in it but I'm 70 so it didn't take much muscle and just a little patience. The containers are very sturdy and the lids seal tight. The labels are a bonus for being able to see what's in them. Some of mine went in pull out shelves in my cabinets base. I put the labels on top of the lid and can see what is in each container. Great product!\", 'Title: Pantry organization; Content: This is my favorite set of new storage containers were my favorite, and I should have ordered another set. Anywho, I operate a small, home-based baking business, but very little storage space. My ingredients are safe in these air-tight containers. I used a separate set of larger chalk labels for these square containers. I would definitely recommend this set.', 'Title: BPA Free; Content: I like the variety of sizes; I like the clearness to see product stored; I like that you can shake containers holding food that has aa tendency to get hard (like brown sugar) and be able to prevent this; I like that the lids stay on firm when knocked over; I like that they can be stacked and not take up room in pantry', \"Title: Love these, great for organizing pantry snacks.; Content: I have given 5 stars, because I love these containers. But one of my lids did come in with one of the snap down pieces broken off, it was in the box but wasn't able to fix it. However I still used the container cause it did still have 3 other snaps on the lid. And still works great, so no big deal. Would definitely recommend them if your OCD like i am and have to have everything in certain spot. Also great for organizing your pantry.\", \"Title: You Won't Regret This Purchase!; Content: I love, love, love this product! I will definitely purchase an additional set! These containers bare sturdy (good thickness), but not heavy, the seal is firm and tight, and the large ones hold an entire packag of flour and the smaller ones hold the whole package of sugar!

I recommend these containers to anyone thinking of buying.\", 'Title: Happy to find containers that have tight closing lids!; Content: I was looking for containers that were big enough to store my various types of flours that I use, and found that these are sturdy, and the lid closed well. I also liked that it came with labels so that I could write down what is in each container. The different sizes were ideal to store flours and grains.', 'Title: Why did I wait so long to get these???; Content: Love these containers!! They are sturdy, clear and sturdy. We are finally able to see everything in the pantry!!', 'Title: Great value; Content: Great product. Holds an entire bag of flour or sugar.', 'Title: Great value; Content: Great set of canisters to organize my pantry. All my flour, sugar, salt, and spices so nicely organized and labeled.', 'Title: Nice; Content: These are amazing containers. I bought these to secure daal and other cooking stuff and it really is so good. Want to buy another set.', 'Title: Not as clear; Content: They are definitely not as clear as pictured. I was hoping for a very clear, clean look. They might be okay for the pantry but I don’t want them out on my counter anywhere. They remind me of the Rubbermaid or Glad containers you get at Walmart. I haven’t decided if I will keep them or not.', 'Title: Not clear; Content: The containers aren’t clear like in the picture they are just dollar store tupaware. They are air tight that’s the only plus all containers even the y’all’s ones are small', 'Title: Questionable quality; Content: One of the tall containers came damaged. Hopefully it is possible to get a replacement.', 'Title: Apology; Content: What a big disappointment and waste of money. The photo shows various sizes of containers and all I received were containers of the same size. Now I will have to use my old containers because too costly to return and I can’t afford to buy new ones. Will not be buying from you again especially when products are misrepresented by your incorrect photos. I wish to apologise for above comment. On further examination I did get different sizes but it was the way they were packed that made the containers all look the same. So sorry about my comment.', 'Title: Decent containers; Content: These containers seem to be ok. I just opened them so can\\'t attest to the \"airtightness\" but opened the box today that appeared to be re-taped so I\\'m assuming someone already returned them. Unpacked them all and found two containers that were broken. They are still usable and the lid fits snuggly but it\\'s frustrating that 1. They are broken and 2.

No more shuffling through half opened packages of pasta/beans/etc. or worrying about a mess after my son gets a snack and doesn’t close a bag all the way. They close easily and tightly and they are clear so you can see what’s in them but also come with stickers which I used to label and include cook times. And you can erase the label with some water and a sponge so that if you change what you put in them, you can update the label without trying to peel the sticker off and deal with that mess.', 'Title: A Must Buy for Organization; Content: Buy these storage containers! They were packaged beautifully and I kept unpacking thinking it’s so many. You can’t beat the price for the amount of containers and quality of containers. Lightweight containers, but sturdy. I also love that all the lids are interchangeable. Would highly recommend!', 'Title: Nice and good price; Content: I like them. I thought I was getting more qty of the big tall containers, but you get most small containers in the package but they bring a lot so it’s good. It’s worth the price and I love them. It makes my kitchen look more organized', 'Title: Wish I had bought 2 sets while on sale.; Content: Air tight storage. Love that you can choose the color of the rubber seal.

Love these !!!', 'Title: Exactly what I wanted and more.; Content: This product matched pieces I already have. Description accurate and easy to unpack. I am using these containers to organize my pantry.', 'Title: Bug protection; Content: I got these because somehow I ended up with beetles in my apartment. One of those beetles is a grain beetle (lucky me!) So I’ve become extremely paranoid about eating food out of the pantry. I couldn’t find them in any of my food but after cleaning out my cabinets I will no longer eat anything that wasn’t stored in the an airtight container. This meant I suddenly needed A LOT of containers. These worked out PERFECTLY. I’m not currently using all of them which means when I come back form the store, I have a few handy! I wanted some that were dishwasher safe because hand washing them after they were emptied would become annoying pretty quickly given how many containers I’m using. Overall, I’m very happy with these. Plus the market is about 1000 times better than the one that came with my older containers. It writes a lot thinner so I can more easily include the product name and expiration on the label. The one thin that does annoy me that no one has seemed to figure out yet with these kinds of containers is that the bulk of the lid and shape of the container takes up more room than necessary when they’re side by side. A lot of wasted space between containers when your cabinet area is small. (Check what I mean in the pictures)', 'Title: So satisfying and orderly!; Content: So fun to organize my cabinet and pantry with these containers! I was able to get rid of all of my cluttered, hard-to-stack bags of things like chocolate chips, and now I have satisfyingly neat stacks instead! I love that all of the containers can stack on top of each other even if they are different volumes. Makes it easy to mix and match to fit into your space. (However, I will say, if the containers are empty, they don’t nest together compactly—see picture for nesting example if you need to store extras.) The labels are really cute and are easy to apply (just be careful not to get air bubbles under the stickers), and I love the chalk marker that comes with it. I haven’t washed any containers after putting the labels on them, so I can’t say for sure how long they’d stick after a wash, but the labels seem like they’ll hold up really well even with a few washes (and since they’re storage containers, you won’t be washing them as frequently as regular dishes). I’ve gently wiped the chalk off a few as I’ve made changes to my labeling, and the water from that hasn’t loosened the stickers at all. I’m so excited to keep my pantry more organized and keep things from going stale in our un-air-conditioned, sometimes humid house!', \"Title: If you love to organize GET THEM; Content: I love these containers they come with labels in a marker they are durable and the airtight seal clicks right on I shook up the brown sugar the pop the top did not pop off and the sugar did not spell out these make the kitchen look really nice and neat I did not use the labels because I tend to switch up the use of the container often but if you want to keep the same thing in the container then definitely use the labels these containers speak for themselves if like me you love to organize arrange and make things look neat clean and classy I definitely recommend these containers I wish they came with different color tops or different color container or something just a little more pop-worthy but other than that they get a 10 in my book I didn't throw them on the ground to see if they will break but they seem pretty sturdy.\", \"Title: Handy Storage Containers with Darling Labels; Content: I love these storage containers. Just check out my photo to see how handy these containers are. I love the labels too so I hope you can see how convenient they are in labeling what's inside. They are air tight and very sturdy. It's also easy to change what the label says. These labels can be reused over and over depending on the need. It's such a great feeling to be organized and it's even better to find what you're looking for quickly and easily by having a container with a great labeling system such as these containers have. You get a lot of containers in different sizes for an even better price! So, as far as value goes, these fit the bill nicely! I know you'll enjoy these containers as much as I do.\", 'Title: Great for (finally) getting my pantry organized!; Content: These containers are great! My pantry is never super organized so I was a bit skeptical about how much I’d use these, but they’re great. The kids are easy to snap on, the sizes work well for standard quantities of pasta/pretzels/etc, and they stack easily on top of each other. The instructions suggest hand washing the lids but I put them through the top rack of the dishwasher without any issues. I do wish there were more large containers vs small since we needed the largest sizes for things like a small bag of veggie straws, but overall this set is a nice value and works really well!', 'Title: Useful 24-Pack Food Containers, 1 Lid Fits All; Content: In this pack you get 24 variously sized air-tight food containers. Once you get them and take them all apart, you realize what a big supply of containers this is! The plastic is flexible and seems sturdy. You get snap-on lids for them – one size fits all. This is a really useful set, and could be utilized to store all kinds of other things as well, from hobby supplies to arts and crafts. The price of $47 is not inexpensive, but then, you’re getting a big pack. In fact, that’s less than 2 dollars per container. You also get black labels and a white pen.', 'Title: 5 stars!; Content: Just spent a lovely day reorganizing my pantry after receiving this set of storage containers. The containers are great - varying in sizes, with lids that snap on just right, cute chalkboard labels.

My pantry looks great BTW.', 'Title: great item; Content: This is a great item! It has 24 pcs of container. In the container, you can keep things like snacks, food and e.t.c.

I was skeptical when I first opened the main delivery box because the box they come in isn't the fanciest. But after opening them .. they look really cool and the kids do go on very snug so no leaks.

It is impossible to read on the black label.', 'Title: good with a few flaws; Content: They are a bit smaller than I expected but okay. The biggest issue I had was fitting the lids on the containers, it was just really difficult.

Just a headache trying to get the lid on.', 'Title: Great price; Content: Not the best construction. I have better containers. But the colors are cool. Price is great.', 'Title: Tight and fit container; Content: It’s useful n fits stackable in the pantry', \"Title: Great price to organize my pantry; Content: These are a great bargain and I needed a lot of them to organize my pantry. They take up a bit of space because the snaps get in each others way, but that is minor. I do have one that doesn't stay snapped as well as the others, but that doesn't seem to effect the airtightness. It did take me a couple times to figure out how to set the lids properly. I use them for cereal, cookies and crackers. I am now living in Missouri (from arid Colorado) where everything gets soggy. This has kept my dry goods dry, something I am getting used to having to do.\", 'Title: Big things are hard to pour; Content: First off, love this. Only issue for us is that we use it for pasta and while it works great for Elbows or Penne, it is tough to pour out Ziti or bigger pastas.

Our restaurants are not providing any type of straws anymore, so we take these with us. The pouch is convenient for transport. I leave it on the table to remind me to remove the straws and stow them away when we finish our meal. The last straws we bought (not your brand) did not provide any type of carrier and I left most of them behind by accident. We're very happy with your product.\", \"Title: Love them; Content: I got these to reduce the use of plastic straws. They come in a bag so you can easily transport them in your purse or whatever. They don't affect the taste of whatever you're drinking and you're doing something great for the environment as a bonus. I will be bringing these with me everywhere!!\", \"Title: Not sealable; Content: They don't close properly.

Served its purpose for organizing dry food items on a kitchen shelf. Four stars because the marker did not work (hence not been able to mark the items) and I noticed that the airtight lids are not so \"airtight\" as the first time it arrived. I am still looking to repurchase another set (because the quality is very good for the price) but it is unavailable at the moment.', 'Title: Good for cereals; Content: Good but one container was broken when it arrived.', \"Title: Storage containers; Content: Great product I recommend it to everyone got it early it's a little smaller than I thought but it works great\", 'Title: Cereal Containers; Content: Like these alot.

Would recommend to anybody!', 'Title: Great but broken; Content: These are exactly what I was looking for. Would have given 5 but one lid was broken on arrival. Contacted the company via email address on box and never got a reply.', 'Title: Received broken; Content: I was so excited to find this product. It would meet all my needs. However one container came broken on the bottom and I can find no way to contact the seller. FRUSTRATING!', \"Title: UPDATE: Hate These.; Content: Update: just found ants in three of the containers, all holding different sugar. Clearly, they aren't air tight. They're worthless. Threw them out, along with about $10 of sugar. Grrrrrrrr, I really like this set of 6 large food containers from Wildone. Each holds 16.9 cups, which is enough for a standard bag of flour or sugar (standard supermarket size, not large box retailer). It comes with a set of chalkboard stickers and a marker. I am also impressed by how they were packaged. Two stacks of three containers, nestled within one another, and flipped, to economize the amount of space needed in the box. The tops were in one stack, the stickers, pen and scoop in another. Very good use of space and a nice thing to see in today's climate. The one thing I don't like about this set is that it comes with one scoop. Either you have to keep the scoop out, and clean of sugar, or you have to remember which container it is in and move the containers around to get at it. The tops are really better for pouring, which means they are more ideal for cereal, rice, etc. You really can't use the pouring spouts for baking because it will come out too fast. That said, I put labels on each, filled them and now I feel super organized and efficient. You can too!\", 'Title: Seal very well, but makes them hard to open. Big box of cereal does not fit.; Content: Pros: Very sturdy and the lid will NOT come off. Shorter, if you have fixed shelves than some other containers. They seal really, really well. I sent them through dishwasher with no issues. Even when pouring heavy (rice) foods, the lid is secure and will not pop off. Labels and pen are nice. Cons: These are smaller than I expected. The big size boxes of cereal (like from membership stores) will not fit. I have some Rubbermaid ones that are 1.5 gallons (sort of oval shaped) that are about the same quality, larger and cost less. Because the hole is sort of indented in the top, cereal (especially small stuff, like oatmeal) tends to get stuck in the indentation. The little lever for pulling up the lid to access the food is too short, it can be hard to pry open. This led to cereal being thrown all over when a kid was struggling with opening. If you have any sort of hand issues they will be hard to open. These are expensive for the quality.', \"Title: Sturdy containers; Content: These are great sturdy plastic containers. Safe for food storage. Lids fit great and the seals feel really solid. The included labels and paint marker are a fun addition. I'm really on the fence over whether or not I would order these again. These are expensive compared to the big box stores. They do seem more durable, but only time will tell if they really are. Another thing to consider...while these will help your food last longer, the boxes take up a lot more room on the shelf than your standard box of cereal/food. Longevity comes at the price of storage space.\", \"Title: Wonderful for preventing spills and keeping things fresh.; Content: I had been using cheep generic storage containers previously so these are a big step up! I had to raise the shelf in my baking cupboard to fit them but it was worth it. No more spilled flour all over! The Good: The large size works well for 5lbs bags of flour, sugar, or rice (it takes about 7.5lbs of rice to fill up a container). The lit and the pour spout both have a gasket around it to help keep in freshness. One end of the containers are indented making it easy to hold it. I placed the labels on this end since that was the side facing out of the cupboards. These are great for storing smaller bulk foods. Think rice, beans, and puffed rice or corn cereal. The bad: The spout is set back in the lid so it isn't possible to easily fully empty the container without removing the lid. It also means with larger cereal (corn flakes) it is easy for them to get caught in the opening. Overall these are wonderful for preventing spills and keeping things fresh.\", 'Title: Excellent storage. Wish there was a measuring scoop for every container.; Content: My pantry is obnoxiously narrow and I was looking for some containers to help organize it. These fit the bill almost perfectly! PROS: + REALLY tight seal! Keeps things fresh and prevents spillage. + You can take the whole top off or just open the pour spout. + There are measurement lines, so you can see at a glance how many cups of flour (or whatever) you have left. + Write-on labels. - The back is tapered for an easier grip when pouring. + A measuring scoop is included. CONS: - Only one measuring scoop. I would like one for each container because not all of my measuring cups fit inside as well as theirs does. - A bit awkward to snap the lids on BOTTOM LINE: Practically perfect', 'Title: I believe I have purchased these before; Content: We store dry goods in plastic containers, that can be well-sealed to prevent any spoilage or bugs. I also put my bird seed in the containers to make sure the seed stays fresh and bug free. Sometimes, getting the top to seal properly, I have had to open the lid, attach it to the base and then close the lid. It works for me. And my husband loves putting his cereals in the plastic containers. He wants to see an entire line of plastic containers. I think he has gotten his wish.', \"Title: They don't stack well together on the shelf; Content: My biggest complaint is that if you plan to store them next to one another on the shelf (like I did; you can see my picture of them all holding bird seeds/foods), the tops may be touching but because they are tapered, there's a big gap from the top of them all the way down to the bottom, which makes it look like they're not next to one another. I had pictured them lining up and sort of fitting in seamlessly next to one another on the shelf. This does mean that it's easy to grab each one off the shelf, but it feels like there's just a lot of wasted space and it makes me not want to put them together. The lids are a little finicky to snap on, and I had to really push hard to get some of them on. However, they do seem to seal up nice and tight, and I like the pouring function. This will be most useful with dry goods that you like to pour (and not measure), like cereal.\", 'Title: Storage for a variety of pantry items; Content: I like the versatility of this set. They can contain pantry goods such as cereal, dried pasta, beans, sugar, flour, hard candy and just about anything that is dry and pourable. The seals appear airtight, and the pouring opening is easy to manage. The snap-on lids are a little difficult to get in place however, and may be problematic for someone with arthritis or little strength in their hands. It would also be good to include individual scoops for each unit. The labels and marker are a nice bonus.', 'Title: Make sure you wash them first; Content: Full cereal box', 'Title: Seals Tightly, Maybe a Wee Bit Smaller Than Expected; Content: I like these a lot, but if you are expecting to use them for cereal, I hope you buy the small boxes. My 16 ounce Dr. Pepper bottle is almost taller then they are. That is their only drawback. They look cute in the pantry, and they seal tightly. The pour spouts are great for rice and pasta. I would buy them again, but I question whether they really do fit a family sized box of cereal. My cheerios box says it has 20 cups in it, which is a bit bigger than the 16.9 these claim to hold.', \"Title: Well made and just the right size; Content: We're always looking for ways to organize our kitchen cupboards and to make better use of storage space, so these six containers are welcome. We're using them for sugar, flour, rice, Splenda, bran flakes and generic Cheerios. The containers are just the right size -- they hold enough to be useful, but they're not so large as to be a problem fitting into cupboards. The tops are easy to get on -- you just clamp all four sides of the top to the base and you're done; from then on, your just open the pour spout on top to get to the contents inside. The tops and the pour spouts are all ringed in a rubbery silicone so that the contents are sealed in once the top is in place. It's good to be able to see how much of the contents we have left so we don't run out. We really like these and are happy to have them.\", 'Title: Great Organzational Tool for Your Pantry; Content: Fantastic storage items. If you want to get your pantry organized, these are the ticket. They stack easily, they clean easily, they are made of a durable plastic that held up in the wash and the tops click down with effieciency. I’m really impressed with these. I also love that they come with chalk labels, and a pen! That’s an extra little bit of niceness in the package. Plus, the extra labels in case you mess up. Overall, very satisfied with this product. I use these to store: Cereal Flour Sugar Oatmeal Rice Pancake Mix Dried mashed potatoe mix It’s working very well for me.', \"Title: so far, so good; Content: I like these a lot- they are perfect for the pantry (cereal, pasta, grains, granola, snacks) and also for storage around the house- I'm always looking for narrow storage for my art studio. The seal seems tight and does its job, but often with time and washing (even gentle washing) the seal degrades, so if that happens I will absolutely update my review to reflect that. Because without the seal, these storage containers become bins, and don't really do their job as far as keeping food fresh. But right now I'm very pleased with them.\", \"Title: Nice set of storage containers; Content: These containers had a bit of an odor to them at first, but after washed in hot soapy water and left to air dry/air out, they're fine. They're typical cereal size containers and are great for dry goods. The lids seal nice and tight. They're very similar to the snapware sets. A measuring cup is included with the set, as well as the labels and pen. I am happy with them so far and have no complaints with them as of yet. If that changes, I will update my review.\", \"Title: Space Savers; Content: I have had big Tupperware containers for decades and have been happy. But you can't see how much you have left and the round containers don't fit well on shelves. There is always a lot of unusable space. These containers solve both of those concerns! They snap shut tightly and fit perfectly on the shelf. And I can put a ton of stuff in each. I'm very happy with these.\", 'Title: well made, good seals, easy to use; Content: I like these storage units. They come compactly shipped, are easy to use, seal the food tightly, and are a good size. I like that the plastic is free from BPA.

Also comes with one scoop', 'Title: Protected; Content: I love these containers. they are very convenient. you can stack them and put just about anything in them including liquids. I would recommend this product to others.', 'Title: Great for dry goods; Content: These work well for baking goods, or sprouting seeds, or loose herb for making infusions. Love the way they stand tall with a small footprint in the pantry.', 'Title: Good deal and large container; Content: Great size and look nice side by side. Love the fact that you can mark on them what it contains and they seal very well.', 'Title: gorgeous organization; Content: I had fun organizing my pantry with these! The size is perfect for all items, especially flour and sugar. I had many baking products that were small, like cupcake papers and jimmies and frosting tips and icing bags: I made one of these just to hold the smaller stuff and corral it all in one place. I go to make cupcakes and just use the one container that holds all the accessories! I did the same with gravy packets, taco seasoning, etc. I just put all of the small into one of these again to make the pantry neater and it worked well. Plus everything stays cleaner! These seal tightly, have a pour top, and are fun to make labels for. When done it looked just amazing! Photos coming!', 'Title: Perfect for the pantry; Content: We use these for cereal, sugar, flour, rice, etc. They are well made and seal perfectly.

Well there not so cut when you get them home and try to use them. They're cheap!

However, the handles have sharp edges where attached to the cup and also a space between handles and cups that gets food in it and is very hard to clean. Handles are heavy then the smaller sized cups and cause them to tip and rest on the end of handle rather then stay upright so you have to hold the measuring cup while you are filling it.

They came with a huge ring but the cups have a problem sliding on the ring. The silicone color is a little too much and doesn’t let it slide. I am concern that the handles might eventually detach itself if it has too much weight. It looks like two different pieces of metal.', \"Title: Easy to measure; Content: Gave it a three because of one thing. You put the cups and teaspoons on a round ring that go into long oval holes. There's no ease of use trying to move from one measuring item to another. So they're all taken off the ring for ease of use. The color coded sleeves are nice but prevent the items from easily moving on the holder. Otherwise, I like them. I used plastic measuring cups for 30+ years probably and the metal cups are much easier to use.\", 'Title: Ok; Content: Unless you have a large kitchen these things take up too much room. You have to remove every cup from the ring use the ones you want. Clean them than put them all back on ring in order.

But other than that these are great', 'Title: Excellent, but Cup quantities tiny and very hard to read; Content: Solid metal, attractive color on handles.

The only concern is that the material is not quite as sturdy as other measuring cups and spoons.', \"Title: They're just Okay; Content: I like the measuring cups, they're very sturdy and have a good weight tothem. But the spoons are kind of annoying in how thick the rubber part is, they don't lay well and it's rough to get off the metal wire that stores them together. The hole should be a tad larger , then it'd be fine.\", 'Title: The measuring cup handles Bend; Content: The measuring spoons are extremely sturdy.

Filling the 1 cup up the handle bends every time and has to be bent back. Happens with all the measuring cups. Otherwise I love them.', 'Title: Quality; Content: These are great. When you scoop flour, for example the handle bends a little. It bends right back but it could be made a little better.', 'Title: Great measurement options, store a bit goofy.; Content: The thick rubber bib on the handle makes them hang a little odd on the ring or when stacking, otherwise they are great. Just don’t store super well.', 'Title: Mighty fine!; Content: They are not nimble and light but I didn’t want nimble. For serious cooks these will stand the rest of serious use and abuse. They clean up well and because the measuring cups ARE rather sturdy/heavy they don’t fall over if you set them down full of contents. The spoons are equally excellent and use. Again easy to clean and keep going. Both sets are now in almost constant use. The East to read measurements make quick work of glancing and cooking and moving quickly', \"Title: Metric, too, for non-US recipes!; Content: Don't be fooled by the kid on the box. Unless you're someone who scoops shortening for some reason I can't understand, these are strong enough for normal adult use. I got them for the color coding for a husband who doesn't always know where his glasses are, as well as the engraved measurements that won't wear off for my son and me, and was surprised to find the measurements are both US and metric, which is amazing, because now I can use recipes from outside the US without converting!\", 'Title: Absolutely in love!; Content: These are fantastic! I am on a kick to get rid of all plastics in my home. My old measuring cups that the plastic handles have broken off of, the plastic spoons that you can not longer read, and so on. These are durable, being stainless steel, very easy to read, the colors look great in my drawer, and the sizes are even fantastic! They even have a 1/8th measuring cup! So much nicer when there are only two of you, and you have to cut a recipe in half or more.', 'Title: Extremely well made; Content: The cups are extremely well made. The reviewer that said the handles bend must have a different product than me because these have absolutely no give on the thick handles. The spoons have really complete measurements. The only thing is that the rings that hold them together are too thick to allow them to be used efficiently as they don’t slide easily. Also, there are too many cups and spoons to be easily used without taking them off the rings. All in all these are a great deal and well made. I’ll separate them and use thinner rings but they’re great.', \"Title: GREAT MEASURING SET; Content: LOVE THIS SET BECAUSE THEY ARE COLOR CODED, YOU GET TO THE POINT WHEN YOU COOK OR BAKE YOU GET TO KNOW THE COLOR EQUATED WITH THE MEASURING SPOON OR CUP, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE IF ITS 1TBSP OR 1TSP , YOU KNOW IT IS BY THE COLOR YOU USE IT SO MANY TIMES, BUT IF NOT YOU DO HAVE THE MARKINGS ON THE SPOONS/ CUPS.. EASY TO CLEAN AND USE...ITS A NICE SET\", 'Title: Nice Quality But Difficult to Organize and Read; Content: I love these measuring cups and spoons, BUT Although the ring organizer is somewhat helpful, it is difficult to get the cups and spoons on and off the rings. Going to have to figure out some other organization method. The ring doesn’t make use easy either. The measurements are hard to read as well. I have used 1Tbsp and the recipe called for 1 tsp. That can mess up a recipe.', 'Title: Good, affordable product; Content: Got a \"really nice\" set of measuring cups and spoons for a wedding gift, and they fell apart after a few months.

No more dollar store cups & spoons for me. Worth the price!!', 'Title: A Big Hit with Everyone; Content: This measuring spoon and cup set is a big hit. Everyone loves them who sees them when they come to my kitchen. The vibrant colors and the fact that they are all together and stay together making it almost impossible to loose them or misplace them. The stainless ring that holds them together is sturdy and rust free. This set is sturdy and will probably last longer than me. I love baking and this set makes it easier for me to measure my ingredients with out stopping and looking for measuring spoons and cups. The vibrant colors and shiny stainless steel makes baking fun.', 'Title: Measuring cups and measuring spoons; Content: I like these measuring cups and measuring spoons, they are permanent labeled on them what they are, and they seem to be dishwasher safe so far. I am going to buy a set of these and give them as a gift at Christmas time for someone.', 'Title: Just what I wanted; Content: I got this a gift for someone who kept buying the cheap plastic ones. After a while with those we always have issues with the labels being washed off and not knowing which cup or spoon is what. These have the labels etched in, so they will never fade or disappear. They are neat and durable.', 'Title: useful for measuring different quantities; Content: used for measuring ingredients for recipes for cooking and baking. very helpful for halving and making 1 1/2 recipes. the measuring spoons even have sizes like 1/3, 3/4,and 1/16th teaspoon and 1/2 tablespoon. the cups have 1/8 cup. Sturdier than most sets and easy to use.', 'Title: Perfect; Content: These measuring spoons and cups are far better than I anticipated. They have both standard US measurements and metric measurements. They also have the best range of sizes I have ever seen. 1/2 tablespoons and a 1/16 of a cup. I recommend these.', 'Title: Very colorful; Content: I like my New measuring cups and spoons they are very colorful and sturdy all the measurements were on the right cups and spoons. Can be removed from the ring if you wanted to.', \"Title: Great measuring cup and tablespoon set!; Content: I have to be careful when measuring for my husband, since every tablespoon, ounce or gram has to be counted. I use these with every meal and almost every snack. And because they don't just come in the standard 4-5 count quantity, it means if I need to measure 1 thing that is 1/3c and 1 that is 2/3c, I don't have to wash it right away. I can use both. But I will be getting more because, like I said, I use them multiple times a day.\", 'Title: Love stainless...; Content: Very sturdy, and very well made. Great variety of sizes as well. Easy to use, read, and clean. Stack together for easy space saving storage. You will be using these often, and will be very pleased.', \"Title: Bad quality, bad service; Content: Literally out of the box the handle came off the 1 cup measuring cup when I was placing them in my drawer. Contacted manufacturer for a replacement 1 cup measuring cup. They offered $3. Told them that does me no good because I'll have an incomplete set. They advised me to return it rather than just send me a 1 cup measuring cup to complete my set. Frustrating. I really wanted to like these, they look great and function well. But I'm boxing them up and sending them back because I'm sure it won't be long until the next one breaks and I get offered $3 again, rather than the piece I need for my set.\", 'Title: Barely Used These - Broke Already! Would Not Buy Again!; Content: My husband purchased this measuring cup set for me - I have used only a few times, and the one cup measuring cup has already broke.

Cheaply made, am very disappointed with these, would not buy again!', \"Title: Broke after five months; Content: I purchased this set in May of 2020. After five months of moderate use the handle has completely broken off of the 1 cup. The handles are very poorly welded on to the cups. The handle on a 1 cup should be able to support the weight of 1 cup of food/liquid. I still love the measuring spoons, that there is a round spoon and a narrow spoon on each side. And the magnets prevent them from getting lost in my drawer. But my guess is that the rest of the measuring cups aren't going to last long, which is disappointing.\", 'Title: Inaccurate measurement labels; Content: Two different sized measuring cups are both labeled 1/4 cup.

The materials used are thin. They claim 18/10 stainless, however if it is its SUPER thin and flexible. The cups handles are tack welded on, and bend precariously with any weight. Honestly not worth the hassle to return, so if they end up surprising me I'll edit this review... shouldnt have expected a lot for the price, but even so I was disappointed.\", 'Title: Product came but two measuring spoons are missing.; Content: Nice product but I am missing 1tsp and the 1/2teaspoons measures.

Be careful not to cut yourself when washing', 'Title: The ring on the cups is NOT removeable; Content: These were just mediocre in quality.

Need to be careful not to bend them. The size is not easy to read. Because of the straight sides to the cups, they are not as easy to separate, especially when you are in a hurry.

Easy to separate, stay together in a drawer, love the extra sizes (eg. 1/2 Tablespoon) which are very convenient for when recipes are doubled or halved.', 'Title: Handles are not the sturdiest.; Content: Had them for a week or two, and I just went to scoop some flour and the handle came right off of the 1cup scoop.

They are very sturdy and clear to read. The magnets make for quick clean up and less hassell to store them. The grips are nice but do leave something to be desired as they don't cover the whole handle. One of my biggest complaints is that the holes to hang the cups from aren't nearly big enough to accommodate most of the hooks ive tried and the ones they do fit on, don't fit right and they look awkward. The box was damaged in shipping but the product was fine. Quality control check was poor and that's why I gave it a 4 star rating. They were very dirty and scratched some on the lettering, and I had to clean them really well before the pic. I feel that could've been avoided just by someone checking the final product.

They are dishwasher tolerant--I place on top shelf. My only qualms are the sturdiness factor and the ability as I age to read small print even with Rx glasses. One must take care not to bend the handle when dipping out flour or it could break. That being said, I am hard on utensils in the heat of creating and if handled with forethought, it probably won't be a problem. The alternative is a $50+ Williams & Sonoma set. The magnetic strip on the spoons is a handy feature on a mounted mag strip above the stove too.\", 'Title: Nice Measuring Cup Set; Content: I purchased these because the measurements were printed on my previous measuring cup set and were wearing off. I like that these were stainless steel and that the measurements are etched right into the cups. I would give this 5 stars if the measurements were also etched into the measuring spoons, but they are printed on them. I’m guessing they’ll start to wear off over time and I’ll need to replace the measuring spoons (edit: they measurements are already wearing off after only a couple months). Also, the ring to keep the cups together is nice, but you can’t stack all the cups together nicely and keep them on the ring. I just threw the ring out. Mostly quality product. One of the teaspoons had what looked like a cut in it that they welded back together. I didn’t think this was worth sending them back for a replacement, but it doesn’t look the best. Otherwise, the rest are a smooth stainless steel and haven’t rusted or anything with multiple washes in the dishwasher.', \"Title: Almost perfect; Content: Price for this I thought was excellent and I love the magnetic measures. I've been using both sets a lot and the one thing I have started to notice is on the measuring cups where I use heavier ingredients and dip the cup in my contaoner, such as sugar they are bending where the handle meets the cups. I'm wondering how long they will last. If it wasn't for the bending happening it would be all 5s. It is easy to read measurements, and I love how it's two sided and different shapes for the measuring tbl and tsp.\", 'Title: A Nice Set.....Except For The Ring.........; Content: I do like these measuring cups and spoons. They appear to be sturdy and should last me a long time. My only complaint is that the cups are on a ring. I have not been able to open the ring so I can remove the cup, or cups, I want to use. It is troublesome to use them while attached to the ring. I am going to get my neighbor to see if he can open the ring for me...if not I am just going to have him to cut the ring so I can take the cups off. Since they stack inside one another storing them will be no problem and, honestly, I do not need that ring at all.', \"Title: Silicone Handle Arrived Damaged; Content: I love these! However, the silicone handle insert in the 1/4 cup was split right out of the package. Disappointing, and surprising, as this feels like a quality set overall. Had my husband patch it up, but it definitely won't last as long as the intact pieces because it's going to catch on things.\", 'Title: Overall good product; Content: I like the measuring spoons. They are double sided with one narrow side that can fit in a spice jar. They are magnetic and stack nicely. I keep my measuring spoons and cups in a drawer. The cups come with a ring attached which is removable. The one thing I don’t like about the measuring cups are the padded handles. It’s good that they are color coded, but the handles don’t lie flat. The padding makes the handles splay upward when the cups are nested. Not the end of the world, I just separated into 2 stacks to fit in my drawer. I like the range of measurements.', 'Title: Pleased enough; Content: I do love these. The spoons stay together strongly. The cus are a bit thin and the ring that holds them is not of any use if storing tgem in a drawer, as it is way to big. However you can remove the ring wasy enough. Quality is not the best i have seen but then fact there are magnets holding everything together will be helpful of not losing anything.', 'Title: Measure Up!; Content: Arrived as expected. Magnetic spoons are great with easy to read measurements. The cups are not easy to read. Good variety of measurements. Sturdy. No mention about suitability for use in dishwasher.', \"Title: Levwler doesn't go all the way across; Content: I have had cheap sets of measuring cups, for year. With the amount of bake I have been doing lately, I need a little more sturdy and these are great. The only problem that I have is that the leveler that came with it does not go all the across the big cups.\", 'Title: Love the magnets.; Content: I love the idea of the magnets but will probably not put in the dishwasher.. also scared these will rust so I dry thoroughly immediately after washing.', \"Title: Great set - wish I'd made this minor investment years ago....; Content: A full range of increments is handy and useful. Having both style shapes on the measuring spoons is very handy. So is having them magnetized - keeps them all together and easy to find. The cups are great too - would love to see a set of increments from 1 - 2 cups too!\", 'Title: Good Purchase; Content: This set has most of the sizes that I needed which I have not seen in others. I like that the measuring spoons are magnetic. However, the measuring cups feel that they can bend easily if I am not careful.', 'Title: Daily use.; Content: These are exactly what you expect. Not the greatest quality, but do the job. For the price I would have expected a little more. Another review stated they have sharp edges, they do, but not so much that your cut yourself unless you don’t know what you are doing. The spoons will bend if you use them on something like peanut butter.', 'Title: Need to be careful with these; Content: They weren’t quite as sturdy as I would have liked. I can see the handles getting bent when scooping something hard like brown sugar. But I needed spoons to get into narrow spice jars so they work good for that.', 'Title: Good but maybe not as sturdy as I thought; Content: Had these done 2 months and the 2/3 cup split in a few places. I only use these for normal baking and cooking ingredients so I guess it was just a dud. The others are okay..so far', 'Title: Not too shabby; Content: Not a bad set of measuring cups that are easy to clean and are not fragile. My only negative is the way they do not easy move around on the ring that keeps them together. They cause the cups to shoot out in different directions and can be a struggle to get them back in a nested position', \"Title: Love them!; Content: I haven't used these yet, but an excited to this week! I'm excited to have a metal, sturdy, matching set of cups and spoons. I'm most excited about the narrow end of the spoons being able to fit into spice jars!\", 'Title: Thin Handles Can Bend; Content: Wish I had read the negative comments before I purchased these. I do like the smaller increment cup sizes and that they are dishwasher safe. But, when I tried to scoop out store-bought, refrigerated cookie dough with the tablespoon, the handle is easily bent ~ pretty flimsy. The same is true for the cups ~ very thin handles.', 'Title: If you cook, you need these!; Content: These measuring cups and measuring spoons are made of high quality steel. They are easy to read, easy to use, and easy to clean. The measurements on the cups are actually stamped (embossed) onto each handle, so they won’t disappear like the ink stamped ones do. The measuring spoons are magnetic and will stay together. The spoons are identified with different colored labels, and I say here that the actual measurements are inked onto the colored labels. The ink may eventually come off, but that is not a game changer for me. There are also additional sizes in each set. The cups also have 1/8 (2 tablespoons) and 1/16 (1 tablespoon). The spoons also have 3/4 teaspoon and 1/8 teaspoon (pinch). I will be using these from now on. This is a good measuring set combo that will last a long time. Highly recommended.', 'Title: Great tools for the kitchen; Content: I had been wanting a stainless steel set for awhile now as some of my current plastic cups had broken/gotten lost. Really like the 2-sided measuring spoons, both for the option to use for spices and just having a 2nd spoon of the same size to measure with. Both the spoons and the cups have extra size(s) that most other sets don\\'t have for added value. Having the spoons hold together magnetically is much superior over the rings which I always found to be a pain. I especially like the long handles on the measuring cups-most sets I looked at had really short stubby handles which makes getting into canisters more difficult. My only \"complaint\" and its a tiny one, is the flat part of the leveler is too short for the larger cups. It should be completely level for an entire side. A better design would have one entire side level and the other curved out to allow for ease of holding.', 'Title: This set has everything you need. Go with these!; Content: I have been saving for quite some time to be able to purchase this set. They are worth the extra, money. After baking for over 50 years, I finally have the best. Wish I had these years ago. Whether this is a gift, or for yourself, consider giving the best! There are 5 things that makes these stand out from the rest. 1. There are more graduations on both the cups and spoons. 2. The measuring spoons are not only double ended, but one of the ends is oblong to fit into the spice jars. The double end is also convenient when you need to measure multiple spices of same amount. 3. The spoons are strong magnetic and they stay together well & don’t get lost in the drawer. 4. The set is well marked, and colorful. The measuring cups come on a big ring, from which they can easily be removed. 5. Sturdy stainless steel, quality made.', \"Title: great; Content: These are really nice measuring cups and spoons. I must not have read the description well - I didn't realize the measuring spoons have the same measurement on each end, just in a different shape. For example, one end is a round Tablespoon, and the other end is an oval Tablespoon. I thought it would be like other double sided measuring spoons with like, 1 Tablespoon at one end, and 1 Teaspoon at the other side. It's fine, and nice to have the different shapes for different size containers, just different. I don't really care about the magnetic part about the measuring spoons, but might be nice for some. The measuring cups nest together nicely. Seem sturdy, so feels like they will last.\", 'Title: GREAT set of measuring cups and spoons; Content: LOVE this set of measuring cups and spoons. I have had several sets of plastic ones over the years and finally decided I wanted to buy a nice set. I’m so glad I did! Probably my favorite feature of this set is that the measuring spoons are double-ended. Having the narrow end is great for some of those small spice jars. The measurements are etched into the cups so it’s easy to read and won’t wear off. The measurements on the spoons are printed but are holding up well so far, and I run them through the dishwasher. I like the variety of measurements on both. I could do with or without the leveler - because of the angles it isn’t useful for the measuring cups. I took the cups off the ring due to my drawer depth - they stack nicely. Love that the spoons are magnetic. I’m very happy with this set and would highly recommend them.', \"Title: NO KITCHEN SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS!!!; Content: . What a cool surprise! Several features I have wished for through the years. They stay together, for one thing. There is an 1/8 tsp. (which I think is a pinch?) and not usually in a set and I can get into all my spice jars, tins, etc. Sometimes I need to pour into my hand and then measure or play guesstimate? Someone put it all together. And you can memorize the colors that you need to use most (like teaspoon and tablespoon) so you don't have to try and read small print, but it isn't even that small of a print so it is easy to see. Someone finally got wise to the program. These are smashing,\", 'Title: Especially love the spoons.; Content: I’ve had my own kitchen for 40 years. If I knew about these back then I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. The different colors are great for identification. They are easy to hold and easy to clean and sanitize. But my favorite feature is how the spoons are magnetic and stay together in the drawer! They even come with a leveler. I also like having 2 different shapes of spoon. Good for fitting into various containers.', \"Title: Great variety of sized; Content: I do a lot of baking and cooking. Having spoons and cups of uncommon sizes are really a plus. The colorful handles just adds to them. Being magnetized keeps the spoons from scattering all over my drawer. Also, having two ends to each spoon has turned out to be quite handy. I keep the cups on an easy to open ring hanging on a hook. So they don't take up any drawer space.\", 'Title: EXTENDED SIZES AND COLOR CODED FOR CONVENIENCE!; Content: I purchased a very nice set of nesting magnetic spoons but needed to replace them once I lost part of the set. This new set I purchased carried extended sizes, (1/8 tsp and pinch), and also includes measuring cups. I love the nesting utensils as they are easily organized and rest neatly in my kitchen drawer. When I need them, I can easily find them. Highly recommended.', \"Title: Every size you will ever need.; Content: I like both these products because of all the sizes. Many sets only have 4 basic sizes. Occasionally I see recipes with metric measurements. Now I can use my new measuring spoons for those also. The metal on the cups is a little tinny but I'm not using them for anything hefty. Love the magnet and colors for both products. These are easy to read unlike my old plastic ones where the sizes were the same color and the handle.\", 'Title: Overall Very good, minor flaws; Content: Overall, I love this set (so much so that I purchased some for family as well). However, I did add holes to the spoons so that they could be hung up on hooks along with the cups instead of on a magnetic bar. The only real downfall in the set- I would suggest to the manufacturer to change their leveler- it’s not level. It’s curved for look which is not entirely helpful while trying to accurately measure. Other than that it is a great set.', 'Title: A perfect set!; Content: Perfect! This was exactly what I wanted and needed. I love the rainbow colors, which also helps me color-code measurements and not mistakenly use the wrong one. I also love the shape of the double spoons, plus the many more measurements offered and magnetized for easy storage. The slender-shape spoon easily fits into small spice bottles. Highly recommend.', \"Title: Best I've ever had!; Content: I've been cooking for years with leftover measuring cups and spoons from my family before me. I finally got tired of mismatched and missing measures. These are very sturdy, easily marked, have several intermediate sizes, and are magnetic so they stick together. I especially like that the measuring spoons have two shapes for different styles of spice containers. I should have ordered these years ago!\", \"Title: Pleasantly surprised!; Content: I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of this product. I initially purchased them for our RV but ended up swapping them with the set I had in the house. Increments go all the way down to 1/16 of a cup. No more guessing how much 1/8 cup is or Googling how many tablespoons / teaspoons it takes to get 1/8 or 1/16 of a cup. The measuring spoons have a dry and wet version and are magnetized to keep them together. That doesn't always work especially when in a drawer that doesn't have quite enough room. Overall I like this set and would recommend them.\", 'Title: They’re so Amazing I bought two; Content: I had my eye on these for months before purchasing. Now I wish I had bought them sooner! Even bought a set for my sister and she loves them too. The sizes are easy to grab because color coded. And each one had a side for narrow seasoning bottles which has come in SO handy. Only complaint which really isn’t bad or a big deal is the label colors weren’t as bright as I would have liked. Highly recommend!!', \"Title: This is a great measuring set all around.; Content: These are great! The measuring cups have the size stamped in the metal. The measuring spoons are magnetic and have two different sizes of scoops depending on what size your jar opening is. I removed the ring that holds the cups together. It's too bulky when they are all together and why wash more than what you use. I bought my daughter and both my daughter in laws a set. Love them!!\", \"Title: High Quality; Content: I was a little skeptical about spending this much on a measuring cup and spoon set. However, this is what my boyfriend wanted for Father's Day. I don't say this often, but he was right in selecting an amazing quality product. I love that these are magnetic and don't clutter the kitchen drawers. These are definitely worth spending a little more on for the fantastic quality.\", \"Title: I love this set!; Content: The magnetic spoons stay together neatly in the drawer, unlike any other set I've had. It's also helpful to have the additional options. I chose not to hang the measuring cups, but if I had a good place, I would. I've always wished to have more options in a set, and this one delivered! Sturdy, easy to wash and store.\", 'Title: A good addition to my kitchen!; Content: I love these measuring cups and spoons! The spoons are magnetic so they stick together like a gang in my utensil drawer…no digging around for that wayward quarter teaspoon! Both the measuring cups and spoons are sturdy, and I really like the colored rubber handles.', \"Title: This is a nice combination of measure cups and spoons; Content: These have become my goto measuring spoons. The color coding makes it easier to find the right spoon if you do a lot of baking like I do because you begin to remember which color is which size. I didn't really think I would use the cups a lot, but it turns out they are very handy. I have only one objection, but it is still a 5 star purchase. The leveling tools should be big enough to level the measuring cups. It is not big enough to cover the larger sizes.\", 'Title: Not real stainless steel; Content: True stainless steel is not magnetic, these are not stainless steel.', 'Title: Very good quality for the price. Very happy so far!!; Content: I’ve had these for a couple months, no rust so far. The thickness of the metal is adequate to support almost anything that you would use these for. The added grate/cooling racks are a very nice addition.', 'Title: Worth it, a few changes..; Content: After receiving these I am honestly so surprised with the negative reviews I read. These are thick and durable, seal well, easy to pull apart and overall much better than “name brand” dry containers I have purchased in the past. I ordered the 5.2 liter set and received a WHITE chalk marker, I’ve seen lots of reviews that got a blue one so I’m assuming the company fixed that issue. The two measuring cups each hold 1 cup and have different measuring units on each side. Shipping was crazy quick, I will definitely be buying more of these!', 'Title: Great quality!; Content: Ok let me just say I LOVE THEM! They are heavy, sturdy, easy to clean and most of all big. I use these for everything from resting meat, cooling cookies, sometimes I prep bigger meals and use the tray to hold my veg/pasta/cheese ect. as I cook. I have used these almost every day and no rust in sight!', 'Title: Great value for price point; Content: These have been great so far for the month we’ve been using them. They secure food really well and have a great price point compared to other brands/stores. Highly recommend.', 'Title: Love these, but they scratch easy.; Content: I really love these, and am happy I purchased them! The only downfall is that that they easily scratch, so don’t use any metal utensils on them. Other than that, these are really fabulous!', 'Title: Great; Content: These were still in the box when I went to Sams Club. There I saw a set just like this set, but must less expensive so I felt I had made a mistake buying it. Then I used the largest bowl to make cupcakes. A few days later I was back at Sams Club and looked at the same set. These are much heavier and stay put while mixing. I love this set.', 'Title: I love them for sure and use them everyday; Content: Received it almost 2 weeks. I love them for sure and use them everyday. This set have different size to meet all my needs. They were made with high quality. They all Dishwasher safe and non-slip, which are really nice. They are worth to try.', 'Title: 6 months, and I still love mine; Content: I truly don\\'t understand a negative review on these. I truly believe some people are just cranky old fuddy duddy online shopper unemployed Covid restaurant reviewers with nothing to do. These are fantastic! Shiny! Very sturdy! When I put leftovers in them for the fridge, I just push the lid down tight (easy peasy), you hear the air being pushed out (remember Tupperwares \"burp\" slogan?), and put in fridge. Still airtight a day or 2 later. I love these. SUUUUUPER EASY TO CLEAN. So easy, I don\\'t even bother taking up dishwasher space. A little squirt of dish soap, a little tap water, a quick few swirls and shiny as when I 1st unboxed them. I\\'m just a normal guy, living in Iowa, taken up healthy cooking recently, and I\\'ve lost 30 pounds in 2-1/2 months. Go me!! I use mine EVERY day!', 'Title: Good quality; Content: This is my second time buying these. I bought one set in March of 2020, and the second set last month (October, 2021) because we moved to a place with a bigger pantry. The sets are slightly different, but the changes are good and the differences are not enough to really stand out. The new set has lines on the sides which make lining up the labels easier. The new ones also came with a white pen instead of a blue one which I LOVE. Overall good quality for the price.', 'Title: five stars; Content: This set was the best deal for a combination set. The product itself is of excellent quality. The hinges are strong, the plastic is nice and thick, and the lids are only 2 sizes so very interchangeable among the set. The quality of material is really excellent. Sturdy, nice and square so they fit nice in the pantry, and very good looking. The variety of shapes/sizes is perfect. They fit nicely in my cabinets so I could do away with the clutter of canisters sitting on the counter.', 'Title: Do not buy.; Content: Horrible. Rusted badly after only five or six times through the dishwasher. See photo. Two measuring spoons had very sharp edges, which cut my finger when I hand washed them before using for the first time.', 'Title: DANGEROUS - AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!; Content: These cups are so sharp on the rim!! I put away in the drawer and went to push down on them and it cut my finger so deep I needed stitches:( do not get these! These are not safe and definitely not child friendly. Horrible make! I don’t know why they wouldn’t sand the sides so they’re less rough.', 'Title: Dead Bugs on Arrival!; Content: The cups and spoons are nice but mine arrived dirty and covered in dead bugs...Really surprising considering the shocking amount of plastic they are wrapped in.', 'Title: Not stainless steel.; Content: Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Ordered 21 stainless steel measuring cups and spoons. Spoons are ferrous metal / steel / magnetic Cups are not.', \"Title: Cracked cup so I'm stuck; Content: I've had this set just over a month and found a crack in one of the cups. It's passed the return time so I'm stick. I wouldn't recommend.\", 'Title: Not heavy duty; Content: There is nothing good about this set of measuring cups and spoons. It’s supposed to be heavy duty which as you can see from one of the pictures it’s paper thin metal on the cups. The spoons are heavy duty but aren’t accurate. As you can see from the other picture the two 1/4 tsp spoons are very different sizes and when filled and poured into the other one are different volumes. So this whole set is just disappointing. At this price point I expect measuring cups that wouldn’t be bent right out of the box and measuring spoons that have accurate measurements.', 'Title: Rusted After Washing Once; Content: Really liked these when I first opened them. The material is heavy, and everything looked great, but they have already started rusting after washing one time. The measuring spoons especially, which was the whole reason I bought this set. Not too happy with the quality of these.', 'Title: Not great quality for the price; Content: Poor quality for the price. One cup was damaged and a few handles on the cups were bent. The metal is flimsy', 'Title: Cup are not stainless steel.; Content: Measuring cups are NOT stainless steel. They failed the magnet test. The spoons are... they passed the magnet test. Cups are still good looking and functional but a disappointment when I was setting up my magnetic organizer.', \"Title: small handles; Content: I use my measuring cups every day multiple times a day so they have to be comfortable in my hands. The handles on the measuring cups are very small and uncomfortable so i returned them. If it wasn't for this one small thing I would have kept them.\", \"Title: Read the description of the size of the spoons. Several are repeated.. Dumb; Content: This is a great set. I don't know why they bother giving duplicate measuring spoons for several measurements. They're including mini spoons that are the same size as the next group for the most part. I didn't read the description enough but they make it seem like you're getting all these different sizes when three or four are repeated.\", 'Title: Not bad.; Content: I like these because there are so many different measurements however the measuring spoons are all ready getting rusty after only a few uses/washes.', \"Title: They're fine, better than plastic.; Content: Fine set, does what it advertises. The metal is thin and the edges are kind of sharp, definitely not as nice as a name brand set. You get what you pay for.\", 'Title: Good, missing one part; Content: Good measuring cup. I like that there are lines on the larger sizes showing smaller sizes (ex: the 1 cup has lines also sowing 1/3 and 3/4 cups). Only thing is I didn’t not get a 1 tsp size, got two of the 3/4 tsp size instead. Small complaint really.', 'Title: Sturdy, engraved labels; Content: Very sturdy, almost \"heavy\" for what they are meant for use. I think they\\'re going to last a long time. I like the shape of the spoons for use with spice jars; really makes using them a bit more convenient. I like the engraved labels, though they could be a little bigger & deeper. Biggest Con: the cups bottoms are rounded such that the smaller ones will not \"sit\" because the handle tips them down. Not really a big issue for solids/powders, but liquids would spill. I just wish the bottoms were more square/flat so they\\'d sit up nicely.', \"Title: Very sturdy; Content: These are really nice. They are sturdy, won't have the handle breaking scooping flour anymore. Recommend.\", 'Title: For the price, don’t hesitate!; Content: These are perfect! I hate buying measuring cups and spoons because they either bend, handles break off or they just don’t have all the measurements you want. This set covers them all! The spoons are thick metal. I don’t see me randomly bending them at all. The cups are one molded piece so no handles to break off. And there isn’t a measurement, that you’d need, that isn’t present in this set. They hang easily. Packaged nicely. Just get them already!!!', 'Title: Toss the discolored, hard to read measuring implements, and enjoy quality; Content: I needed some new measuring spoons to use in the preparation of Thanksgiving dinner. The old ones were decades old, and scattered throughout various kitchen drawers. These spoons, and cups, both come with a ring to keep them organized and together. I don’t have to worry about the measurements wearing off because they are stamped into the product, not “ painted “ on. The one criticism that I have is, the locking mechanism on the rings are very difficult to unlock. So much so, that I gave consideration to using them attached. I’m confident that they will loosen up with the passage of time, and continued use. I still rated them 5 stars because it is such a little issue compared to the overall quality and function ability.', \"Title: Very complete, and well-made; Content: I ordered this set because it is so much more complete than any other I have found anywhere. From the photos, I could not tell how solid it would be, and was worried it might be too thin. It turns to be of good thickness and I imagine it will holds up very well for years to come. Take note of all the sies in this set, including unusual ones, both in cups and in measuring spoons. They haven't left anything out, and they are nicely made.\", \"Title: Love this set; Content: I love this set. The measuring cups have more sizes than usual (I use the 2/3 cup for my oatmeal), nest perfectly and the handles are wide so that they are sturdy and easy to hold on to. This is very important to me because I have bad arthritis in my fingers and my hands have a tendency to tremble. The measuring spoons fit perfectly into spice jars. They have a lot of different sizes that you don't usually get with most measuring spoon sets. May not use the tiny set that measures a tad, dash and pinch, but they are there if you need them.\", 'Title: Easy to read; Content: These cups feel heavy duty. I thought they were going to feel thin and cheap but the quality was way better than I thought. I like that the spoons have the sizes engraved it makes for long lasting easy reading. I especially love the little spoons. It’s hard to judge the size of a pinch or a or a tad.', \"Title: These cups do double duty.; Content: Very nice set of measuring cups and spoons. I love the extra set of tiny amounts (dash, pinch, etc.); so cute. The quality is excellent. Stainless steel. Easy to clean. The markings are easy to read and I love that each cup has additional markings for additional measurements. For example, I can use one cup to measure 1/3 cup of oats and the same cup to measure 1/2 cup milk. Less to clean. Double duty. I love that the set includes a leveler and keep it handy for quick use. This set will last a lifetime and would make an excellent gift for anyone's kitchen.\", 'Title: A QUALITY SET OF MEASURING TOOLS; Content: I looked forever for the most comprehensive, matching, quality-made set of measuring cups and spoons — that would fit into spice jars — and these TOTALLY fit the bill. I was skeptical about some negative reviews stating poor finish, rust spots, etc, but honestly haven’t seen one thing wrong with my set. Everything from the metal gauge to the stamped / engraved labels is top notch. And for less than $30 for this largest set, you can not go wrong.', 'Title: You get a lot for your money.; Content: Great deal for your money. The measuring cups are very pretty and shiny. They don’t get scratched up with use and being washed. I like that the cups are one solid piece of metal. No creases or lips that meet, so powders like flour, etc. don’t get caught in between them. Plus they haven’t rusted. The long gated measuring spoons are nice because the fit perfectly when you have to measure spices. And the added bonus are the cute mini measuring spoons for like a dash, a pinch, a drop, etc. They actually do come in handy. I would recommend them.', 'Title: LOVE THIS SET – GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE; Content: Was looking for a new stainless steel set of measuring cups and spoons and hit the jackpot with this one! Love all the various sizes with the cups and spoons (it even has spoons for dash, smidge, pinch, etc.). Easy to clean, very sturdy and durable. If you’re looking for a good measuring set – you can’t go wrong with this one!', 'Title: Easy to use accurate and convenient; Content: This product worked out really well and continues to work out really well basically every day of my life. While I am no chef it does help to have measuring utensils when making recipes from offline which I like to do very often. If you are looking for something well priced easy to clean durable and reliable then you should definitely give this a try.', 'Title: MOST HEAVY DUTY CUPS AND SPOONS EVER; Content: These are AMAZING. sturdy metal cups and the spoons are Sturdy with some weight to them. I’ve went through so many cheap flimsy metal measuring cups and plastic spoons that wear down the measurements but these measurements are engraved on them so they can’t rub off. They are dishwasher safe too. As someone who cooks and bakes every meal from scratch I recommend these to anyone starting out. Worth your money in the long run because you won’t need to keep buying replacements.', \"Title: Great product; Content: Good look. Very high quality. Sturdy. Easy to hold. They have a nice weight to them. Everything but the 4 largest cups (.5C+) can be connected on an optional ring. The ring is a very sturdy interlocking ring on the small cups and the normal measuring spoons so it won't come unhooked easily. The ring on the smallest spoons is a normal key ring.\", 'Title: Very sturdy.; Content: I’ve been using these for sometime now & I can say that they are in fact very well made and great for what they come with. The measurements are on point and they are well organized together. Very strong pieces as well. Unless I come across a problem in the future I see no reason that these shouldn’t be 5 stars.', \"Title: Quality is excellent; Content: Love this product and ordered it early for my granddaughters bridal shower. She loves to cook and bake so these are perfect. She's fussy about quality as I am also and these met the grade with me, sleek modern look as well and easy to pour and clean looking. The extra measuring spoons are a bonus and cool.........loved this and I know she will as well. Thank you for a great product. Study, clean, long lasting and nest well, so they don't take a lot of room to store.\", \"Title: This Makes Me Feel Like A Pro!!!; Content: Oh my gosh what an amazing collection. There is weight and stability to this set of measuring spoons and the measuring cups are so very very nice. I'm no chef but this measuring set makes me feel as if I am. One more thing.......there is a bonus set of measuring spoons and they are not just cute but are funny too. There is dash, smidgen, pinch, drop, etc. Hilarious! This set does not disappoint\", 'Title: Beautiful Heavy Very well made; Content: These measures are the nicest I’ve found. The cups are study with smooth edges and the spoons are heavy and feel like a grade A product. I love the levelers and the storage loops to keep everything together. I would recommend this product.', \"Title: Sturdy and Useful; Content: I ordered this oblong shape of the measuring spoons on purpose to be able to get the spoon into jars with small mouths, like spices. I really like the set and it has more components than you'll probably ever need. I like having metric and Imperial measurements, too.\", 'Title: Good quality; Content: I have measuring cups and spoons already. I wanted these for more accurate measurements. I was quite satisfied with the quality of the sets. I bought 2 sets for friends and one set for me.', 'Title: Heavy duty; Content: Was impressed on how sturdy these things are, easy to clean and something different if you want to stay away from plastic. They stack very well for storage, and also come with rings to keep them together. Would recommend for anyone who likes to cook.', 'Title: Broke on first use; Content: This product was purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter who enjoys baking. The measuring cup handle broke off the measuring cup on first use. The quality is very poor despite it\\'s \"high quality\" description. The handles are glued on (not a solid piece). I do not recommend this product.', \"Title: Terrible cups.; Content: Arrived damaged. Measuring cups are made of two separate metal pieces put together, spoons are a single piece. The connection point for the cups appears very meager for something that is going to be exposed to water hundreds and hundreds of times. I'm so glad they bit the dust while I was still able to return them. I'll be sure to pay close attention to the connection points when looking for a replacement set.\", 'Title: Rusted, not stainless steel. China.; Content: I was going to give a five-star review, I really like these measuring cups. They state they are stainless steel yet they are rusting after two months of use. Real stainless steel does not rust. Cheap Chinese measuring spoons with an American price tag.', \"Title: Super heavy and clunky; Content: The measuring cups are hard to fit together and clunky. Too sturdy for what I need when measuring things like flour. I was looking to replace a set I had for 30 years because the handle to the 1/2 cup broke off and I thought I'd try a colored set of measuring cups, but they are way too bulky from what I'm used to. The one thing I like about the tablespoon is the leveler that's attached.\", 'Title: Most expensive measuring cups on the market?; Content: I just bought a plastic set of cups AND spoons for my sister in Germany at a $ store all for $1. I am sure these are sturdier, but not easier to clean as they are made of multiple materials. In hindsight, should have saved my money for something else. But they ARE pretty...', 'Title: Magnetic measuring spoons and measuring cups; Content: I like the weight and feel of both the measuring cups and the measuring spoons. The handle came off the cup size measuring cup for the second time which I am not happy about. On the measuring spoons the writing that tells you which spoon it is, is wearing off which again I am not happy with. I would like to see both of these improvements.', \"Title: Okay product; Content: Put them in dishwasher and 2 of them rusted and edges are sharp. Don't stack in shallow drawer.\", \"Title: Unique sized cup measures, definitely recommend; Content: Amazing because of all the sizes included, I just love the fact that they have a 2/3 cup and a 3/4 cup measure. This is the only set of cup measures that I need now, so I gave away my old ones. The color coded silicone handles make them fun and pretty, the metal is pretty standard. doesn't scratch easily but isn't the most thick in the entire world. that being said these are high quality and I really recommend them. Worth the money.\", 'Title: Overall good quality; Content: Feels like one gauge heavier and it would last forever though, these just feel a bit lightweight. Also, although they are plainly marked on one side of the handle, I wish the markings were on both sides, as mine hang more conveniently facing the other way.', 'Title: Recommend these utensils; Content: Heavy duty. Numerous measuring cups. Like the ring to keep them on. Only thing I do not care fore is that the rubber sleeves on the handles tend to slide off.', 'Title: Hand washing suggested; Content: My only complaint is that the manufacturer says to hand wash. I have washed in the top rack of the dishwasher, and so far so good. The cups are a little flimsy, but completely adequate for the purpose intended. The best feature is the number and variety of the cups.', 'Title: Tippy; Content: The handles are too long to balance/sit upright while empty. The largest 2 will sit flat, but the rest tip when empty. Nice quality, but bad execution.', 'Title: Metal Measuring Cups; Content: I like the variety of sizes. Handles are not very sturdy, tend to bend when scooping even something as soft as flour.', 'Title: Sturdy products!; Content: Arrived on time. 18 piece set is much more sturdier than I anticipated. Easy to clean and very colorful. I recommend this product for bakers.', 'Title: Great overall product; Content: Bought these for my mother and she has been using them for a month now. Overall these are great, but after a lot of use the silicon handles are coming off and the rings for the cups and spoons are starting the rust (not the cups or spoons themselves but the ring holder).', 'Title: Love them; Content: I love these measuring cups! They are heavy, but like that they can stand without anything in it. I like that the measurement is engraved on the cup and not painted. So it will stay on there and not eventually wash away.', \"Title: The only set you will ever need; Content: This measuring set is probably the only set I'll ever need. I bought it to replace a few other incomplete sets of measuring cups and spoons. These are sturdy, well made, easy to use and read. Easy to clean. I now have a complete set of cups and spoons and they are all in one place. I recommend these.\", \"Title: Love it, but ...; Content: These are by far the best measuring cups I've ever had! They're easy to read, the colors make your most used sizes easy to spot, and they seem to be super sturdy. My only minor complaint is the colored grips are not secured to the metal, they're just kind of slid only the handle, so they twist if you're scooping something with minor force, making the sharp metal corners dig into your hands.\", 'Title: These measuring cups are easy to use and clean.; Content: I like the cups. I have one thing while interesting is also confusing. Why are the measurements in milliliters as opposed to grams? My cooking style is cups for dry measurements and cups for liquid. It was difficult at first, but I have gotten used to it. I like the cups enough to ignore the confusion.', \"Title: These Are Amazing!; Content: OMG I love these!! They're extremely heavy and durable. They're easy to read, color coordinated and has US & Meteic measurements. You'll love these!!\", \"Title: Perfect for me; Content: I hate the plastic type cups, my husband can break them scooping up flour or granulated sugar. Plus the printed labels rub off. Some metal handles easily pop off when he's washing them. Like how on earth do you break the weld when you put you hans into that measuring cup but he cannot explain it. So far these have lasted for a while. Like most metal cups the silicone cover can slide around a little but they have all so far survived the husbands weird uncontrollable strength.\", 'Title: Kitchens need these!; Content: Love these measuring cups. There are a few I don’t use so often but the set is great. Very sturdy and very cute! The measurements are very easy to see.', \"Title: Very well made; Content: I have always wanted stainless steel measuring cups, I have been using my Tupperware ones for the last 30 years or more and a few of them have finally cracked. Many of my measuring spoons have been broken, lost or borrowed. I have three partial sets... I love the weight, the silicone on the handles makes it easy to measure with wet hands or floured hands. I love how many of the cups and the spoons there are! Makes my baking easier. They don't take up any more room than my old ones with half as many cups and spoons.\", 'Title: Strong, rustproof, easily stacked; Content: I like everything about these measuring cups and spoons. They seem well built. The handles are rubber, color-coded rubber thats molded to the handle (they wont slip off.) The handles steel is twice as thick as the cups steel, so they should be strong. They stack very compact and take up very little space in the drawer.', \"Title: sturdy, quality product; easy to use; Content: love that they come on a ring (kind of like a key ring) that is VERY EASY to open and remove the measuring spoons/cups that you need. Appreciate the multiple measuring grades. The bright colors make cooking fun for our 8 yo dtr, with whom we are using a kids' cooking club subscription. Very sturdy product, not flimsy or cheaply made. Recommend to anyone looking for a good set of durable measuring spoons/cups.\", 'Title: Perfect So Far; Content: Very sturdy, easy to read, hold up in dishwasher and they stack in one another. If anything it comes with too many measuring cups for normal use, but you just take those off ring. Great product.', \"Title: Should last a lifetime; color coded, too; Content: I've needed measuring cups and spoons like these for so long! Very glad to have found them. I love how the sizes are engraved into the metal instead of just inked onto the plastic part - the engravings won't fade. The cups and spoons are solid, easy to handle, and the colors make it easy to grab the right size immediately (e.g., pink teaspoon, teal tablespoon, red 1-cup measure). I recommend these measuring cups and spoons.\", 'Title: Very strong, durable, and easy to read; Content: VERY strong and durable. I’m super happy with this purchase. The handle on my old set would bend with certain foods. These have no bend to them at all no matter how dense the food. They are very strong. I am going to buy a second set because I like them so much. I also appreciate the color coding for different sizes. It makes choosing the right one very easy.', 'Title: The magnetic feature is great!; Content: I love the range of sizes of these measuring cups, and the fact that they are metal and not plastic. With 8 different sizes I have a measuring cups for ALL my recipes. The sizes are a little hard to read but I am getting used to it. The magnetic feature really helps to keep them together in the drawer.', 'Title: Great; Content: Loved them for all the sizes, and super big rings for holding them. Would not try to use for melting butter etc on the stove because of plastic on the handles but I have other small metal pots for that', \"Title: I recommend these measuring cups.; Content: It's great to have a 1 cup that has the exact measurement. Rather then having to use 2 . Example 3/4 cup. I hated having to use 1/4 and 1/2 to get 3/4 cup. These are perfect for me.\", \"Title: Great tools; Content: These are great. I have a list on the inside of my cabinets so I know which color is what size but I'm starting to memorize them and won't need it for long. I love the unusual sizes in both the cups and spoons. The cups are easy to clean. They are both sturdy and won't need to be replaced for a very long time, if ever.\", 'Title: LOVE THIS SET!; Content: What a beautiful and functional set for any cook or baker to have in her kitchen! I love them. They are sturdy and solid. The colors make it easy to spot the one you need but they are also easy to read. These have measurements that other sets do not... 4 teaspoons, 1/8 teaspoon, 3/4 cup, etc. Lovely and would make a nice gift.', 'Title: Lots of cups!; Content: Just what I needed - easy to use with lots of measurements - a 3/4 cup! Quick and easy to use. The bright handles are pretty, and the ring that holds them together is simultaneously handy (holds them together tidily!) and silly (I don’t want to wash all of the cups every time I use one, and I’m not exactly hooking them onto my belt loop for on the fly measuring). Overall, very pleased.', 'Title: worst product ever; Content: Avoid if you can, this product is so poorly made and cheap looking it is not worth the money. The Spoon actually bent in soft ice cream', \"Title: Rusting already.; Content: This is very disappointing to say the least. After relatively light use, all of the pieces of this cutlery set are starting to rust from the dishwasher. At first I thought it was the fault of my machine but it's clearly the fault of pathetically poor fabrication. DO NOT BUY\", 'Title: Extremely disappointed.; Content: The steak knives are dull and unusable. The silverware remains blotchy no matter how often we wash and dry it. The blotchiness gives the appearance of dirt and so is also unusable. Had I not hastily thrown the steak knives away, I would be requesting a refund.', \"Title: crooked knives & ladle size spoons; Content: We bought this for camping & the knives are crooked so cutting is difficult & the big spoons are really big. I use the big spoons for serving, although there's not a lot of serving camping. Super sturdy though\", 'Title: No tea spoons.; Content: There are no tea spoons in this set! They have sent serving spoons and dessert spoons. No tea spoons. Buyer beware!', 'Title: Rusty steak knives; Content: I have had the set for 2 weeks and the steak knives are already all rusty and useless. The rest of the cutlery is fine, therefore I will give you 3 stars', 'Title: Nice; Content: I am not an expert. I should have paid more attention. The set is big. Small spoons are the size of my large spoons from prior set. Also very shiny. Hard to keep finger prints off. Price was great though.', 'Title: Large flatware; Content: Nice set of flatware; however, the large spoons I will only use as serving spoons as they are too large to eat with.', 'Title: Steak knives rusted in a week, everything else is great; Content: Everything is great except for the steak knives, which are not dishwasher safe as advertised', 'Title: Bit average; Content: These are just ok. They have sharp edges in places and the spoons are huge!!', \"Title: Great value; Content: I would have given 5 stars but the flatware is super shiny and a very good weight. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, feels expensive. However the steak knives don't really match the quality of the rest of the set, only because the plastic handles are made of a light plastic material. Overall, super please with this purchase, I order 2 sets so that we aren't constantly using the dishwasher!\", \"Title: Copper Flatware; Content: I HOPE that it's a good buy. I love the flatware itself. It is surprisingly heavy and lovely. However, there was no indication on the box of it's care. I wasn't sure if it was dishwasher safe, but after one trial washing, it seemed fine. I just wonder how durable the copper finish is, and whether it will hold up to frequent usage.\", 'Title: Utensils; Content: Pretty pieces. Knives are ok wish they were sharper. Cleans easily', 'Title: The table spoons were a bit large.; Content: Loved the color', 'Title: I received good silverware set.; Content: I like the product a lot. I have lost many pieces from my last set and decided to go a bit cheaper. Trust me the quality did not diminish at all. I love that at this price point it comes with an appetizer/salad fork and a small soup spoon.', 'Title: Still clean; Content: Have been using these for about a year now and none of them have any food dried to them that I cant get off and there are no water spots that get stuck on them. The utensils themselves are very strong and do not bend with little force. Only thing that I would have liked to see is for a tray to have came with it.', \"Title: Beautiful, durable, and mindblowingly affordable!; Content: I don't know if I've ever been happier with an Amazon purchase. I paid less than $12 for this set to use for a dinner I hosted, expecting that it would look awful after a few uses. I've been using the set for weeks now and it still looks as good as when I got it! The copper color of the flatware is gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for. After weeks of daily use, there's no discoloration or staining, bending, or any other issues. Both the knives and the flatware have sat in water and gone through the dishwasher multiple times with no rusting. The only hint that this set is so cheap is the steak knives, which are very light in your hand and have plastic handles but they have worked just fine for me. I'm definitely satisfied with this set and I wish everything I needed could be so affordable! (P.S.- Be prepared. The silverware comes individually wrapped.)\", 'Title: What a bargin; Content: best price for the quality. ive never purchase silverware before, but im so happy i got this instead of the silveware i had in the place im renting. forks are kind of sharp as well, just a heads up. very happy. 5 stars. ty', \"Title: Great value, great product; Content: Unlike many others at this price point, these are sturdy and with big enough handles to hang onto. I'm totally satisfied\", 'Title: Not bad; Content: The box was shipped in a bag instead of a box and came completely undone in the mail. The silverware were hanging out of the box and the knives were on the outside of the box. Some of them came scuffed up. The bigger spoons are alot bigger than I thought. The knives were loose near the handle. Other than that, they were nice.', 'Title: Impressed; Content: The steak knives handle are not very good, but the set is really great quality and value.', 'Title: A great value for the money!; Content: So much nicer than I expected! I was afraid they might be flimsy and look cheap but quite the contrary, they look much more expensive than they actually were!! I am using them for snacks in our theater room so I may wash them by hand to maintain their attractive appearance but they should be dishwasher safe.', 'Title: Nice set; Content: I just received this flatware set. It seems sturdy enough and is simple and attractive. I can’t attest to the durability of it but it’s a great price.', 'Title: Pretty 😍; Content: Absolutely love this set. Has a sharper butter knife. Very smooth. Elegant sleek look. Perfect for my family of 2 🥰. Comes with a setting for 4!', 'Title: Good set; Content: Comes with a dinner setting, soup spoons, teaspoons, salad forks, regular forks and steak knives. Only thing is soup spoons are really big and the teaspoons of regular sized.', 'Title: Solid flatware set is good quality, value; Content: We are loving the new flatware. The heft and solidity of the set was a very welcome surprise! The steak knives are well made with securely riveted handles. A surprisingly good value.', 'Title: Satisfied customer!; Content: This set a great buy! I’ve used them for several months now and they still look brand new. I like that they are dishwasher safe too.', 'Title: Very nice!; Content: Love these! Like the length on the spoons.', 'Title: Utensils are thin and a bit oversized.; Content: Good value for the money.', 'Title: Keeping It Simple, Let\\'s Eat!!; Content: I purchased the black silverware because it was unique, plain, and \"keeping it simple.\" Excellent quality ,very attractive to the eye the table setting, and density in weight well balanced. KEEP IT SIMPLE!!', 'Title: Great purchase.; Content: Great purchase. Cutlery is sturdy and looks really good. Forks are a bit sharp and the table spoons are large but still great.', 'Title: Beware of paint.; Content: Wouldve been a great product but Black coating has been coming off. We handwash only with non abrasive sponges, yet it looks like we are scratching our utensils.', 'Title: Beautiful addition to the kitchen.; Content: Bought these to add a subtle pop of color to the kitchen. They go amazingly with my matte ceramic grey dinnerware! I’ve only had them for about a month, but seem to be holding up well. The only thing I don’t love about them, is that the color seems to show fingerprints more than typical silver stainless steel. Still a great product though, and very happy with them!', 'Title: Wonderful, affordable silverware; Content: These are wonderful! We had been needing a replacement for a while because our kids lose silverware constantly. This price was perfect and they are sturdy and I love the shine they have. I am very happy with this purchase.', 'Title: Great value for money; Content: Heats up a little in microwave compared to other silverware we have. But overall very happy with the product.', 'Title: Perfect Daily Use Flatware; Content: This was just what I was looking for and the price was reasonable. What I like most was the longer than usual handles and the simple design.', 'Title: This set is AWESOME!; Content: This set is flipping fantastic! I’m blown away by what it contains and how wonderful the quality is! This set contains 6 mixing/prep bowls with silicone non-slip bases and tight fitting lids. The bowls have measurements in them which I haven’t seen before. The weight on the bowls is perfect, they’re neither flimsy or excessively heavy. The largest bowl’s lid contains a cutout for the shredder and grater inserts, which is nice, although I’m not sure I’d always need the largest bowl. The nesting measuring cups and spoons are very nice and take up only as much space as the largest one. I like that they fit together for the purpose of being compact but aren’t tied together because I hate taking them apart or having to wash them all. Additionally the tools that come with this set are very nice silicone. The handles are a bit short but they’re functional and pretty. This set is available in other colors but I chose the rainbow set so I could look at cheerful colors. This set would make an excellent gift for a new homeowner or home baker. Would 100% recommend. I’m thrilled with it!', \"Title: Great starter set; Content: If you are looking for a housewarming gift, this is a great choice....or if you are like me and you are tired of looking at a bunch of miss matched pieces. There are 22 pieces and the metal bowls have colorful silicone bottoms so they won't slide around on you. All the measuring spoons and cups stack nicely, and click together to conserve space. This is a great buy.\", 'Title: Made in China — not USA; Content: The silverware set is nice and feels sturdy. 1 star rating because the description stated these are “made in the USA.” They are made in China — as shown in my picture. I don’t appreciate the misrepresentation.', 'Title: Not black but slightly darker silver.; Content: Pulled out our \"silver\" silverware and took a picture to show those who would like to purchase this brand. It is not even close to being black. Very disappointed with Amazon\\'s photo of this item. which is why I took a photo to prove my point. The photo shows our old silverware and a black set we purchased earlier. We wanted more of this design but as you can see they are also \"silver\".', \"Title: Don't buy unless you want to polish; Content: This silverware is decent enough, but as soon as it goes in the dishwasher it looks spotty and tarnished. I would not have purchased these had I know this was the case. Its impractical to have to polish or even hand wash silverware for our busy family of 5.\", \"Title: Lovely, but sharp edges; Content: I was excited to get this set, and I really like the look and weight of the pieces. But the edges felt a little sharp to me. I couldn't see myself pressing down on the fork, for example, without some discomfort. I reluctantly returned it, but would buy it again if the edges were smoother.\", 'Title: Pretty but lightweight; Content: Very lightweight!! You can barely feel that there’sa knife or fork in your hand. They don’t look cheap but because they’re so light, they feel cheap. However, they are good looking! The style is modern and they can match a variety of decors.', 'Title: Spoons for giants; Content: The size of the large spoons are basically mixing spoons. The small spoons in this set, are like large spoons in a normal set. I would give it 5 stars if the spoons weren’t for giants.', \"Title: Pretty Good but Color Issues; Content: My wife wanted to order this set leading into the holidays so that her Christmas dinner table would be perfect. I don't really get it, but I digress. This silverware set is really pretty good. The utensils are a good weight and are well made. The only issue is that the knives are a different color than the rest of the utensils. Everything else has a nice copper hue but the knives look more gold than copper. Not a big deal to me, but my wife notices EVERYTHING. I still give this set 4 stars, and would be 5 if the color was uniform.\", \"Title: Nice set but watermarks more visible on black; Content: Very nice set. Simple and light weight. Serving spoon bigger than normal but doable. I don't like that they do not air try. May be the coating which reminds me of treating an auto for rain to have water bead up and sit. If you don't dry with towel properly causes water marks that are more visible on black. All-in-all it's a nice looking set.\", 'Title: sturdy silverware; Content: They are great silverware, the large spoon and fork are a bit too big for me, i keep using the smaller sized ones, but otherwise they are clean and look great in my kitchen.', 'Title: Different looking and interrsting; Content: Very nice and different looking. Easy to keep and clean. The soup spoons and teaspoons are a bit large. Other pieces are perfect', 'Title: Beautiful but smudge easily; Content: These are beautiful but unfortunately they show every fingerprint. When I put away my clean silverware they are all printed up just from being taken out of the dishwasher and placed in the drawer. This makes it so they never really look clean.', 'Title: Good everyday ware. Tablespoons are huge though.; Content: Nice everyday set, but tablespoons are wayyyyy too big!', 'Title: Nice packaging!; Content: I love the packaging for the silverware! Feels a little delicate but I actually like it, different sizes for utensils! I’m excited to see how long they last and how they actually feel!', \"Title: Nice looking and sturdy; Content: This cutlery set is nice looking and seems sturdy which is good as we intend to use it every day. We keep these in a caddy on our kitchen table so they are handy. We are enjoying the different and unique colour. Note: the spoons are quite large which someone else noted. The smaller spoon is almost the same size as the large spoon in our previous (usual sized) set. In this set the larger spoon is giant - really like a Serving Spoon so you don't need 8.\", \"Title: So chic!; Content: I was looking for a new silverware set to replace my 12 year old set. I wanted something simple, not a bunch of designs. These are so chic, simple, with a very shiny mirrored finish. They don't feel cheap at all, they are a perfect size and good weight. I really like this set, even my mom commented on how nice they are and that she wants a set like mine! I'm very pleased with the price and overall quality. I'm hoping they last!!\", 'Title: No need to eat with my fingers anymore !; Content: Great utensils, would recommend to anyone. Perfect size and weight, the shine is holding up very well despite multiple washing.', 'Title: So happy with my purchase; Content: I’ve had these for about 6 months. They are used everyday and put in the dishwasher each night. They have held up perfectly.', 'Title: Love it!; Content: Love these. My husband and I have been looking for a black silverware set and this was perfect. Good amount, perfect price and great quality', 'Title: Sturdy; Content: I was looking for new set for camp that would hold up to “hard ice cream” test this did fine without bending no issues after several times through dishwasher. Would recommend to others', 'Title: Extremely pleased with these!; Content: These were purchased to replace our old set and we are very happy with them. They are sturdy and have retained their finish after multiple uses. I delayed this review till I could actually use them for a time and am very pleased with them!', 'Title: Heavy duty flatware.; Content: The lines were clean and consistent. All the knives, forks, spoons, etc. were the same size. I washed them first as per the instructions. They look great and feel well balanced in my hand. I like.', 'Title: Great and Sturdy!; Content: These silverware are great and sturdy! They have been washed quite a few times now and I have not experienced any rusting or chipping. They also have a nice decent weight to them. Love these and are great for the Money paid!', \"Title: Great value!; Content: This set was a gift for a young couple just starting out.

Eat and be merry!\", \"Title: High Quality; Content: I've been very impressed with the quality of this utensil set. They are sturdy without being heavy.\", 'Title: Spots of rust; Content: The silverware set is very sturdy I don’t believe that I can bend either size of the forks or the spoons that is a great thing but unfortunately after two months the knives started to show spots of rust which is very unfortunate that is the reason why I got a new set of silverware to begin with', 'Title: Bad for health; Content: 18/0 is the lowest grade stainless steel that you can get. After 1 day of easy use the plating already came off. You will be consuming the metal plating if you use these. Look nice with my blue and gold plateware set but cannot use these.', 'Title: Nope; Content: Not durable, fork not able to pick up the cooked onion, it just bended when I pressed.', 'Title: Badly finished; Content: In this instance, you do get what you pay for. Cheaply finished utensils with ultra-sharp edges (particularly the forks) and haphazard \"stainless steel\" stamps. I doubt the legality of the use of FDA logo on the packaging.', 'Title: Oversized Silverware; Content: I liked the silverware, however, they appear to be twice the size in measurement of typical silverware. The teaspoons are the size of tablespoons. The fork handles on the regular forks are extremely long. The salad forks appear to be regular fork size.', 'Title: Not good quality; Content: Some of the black is separating from spoons after one wash. Not sure if i got a defective pack', 'Title: Does not hold up; Content: So we have had this for about a month. We do not use dishwasher and the coating is completely coming off', 'Title: Spoons are huge; Content: The set is okay but, the regular spoon is huge. A cross between a serving spoon and regular spoon. Unreal! There is no reason to make the spoons this big. I am disappointed. I would not buy this again. I suggest you do not either', \"Title: Not as expected; Content: Hard pressed to find a piece without scratches and marring in the handles of the flatware. I used this at my daughter's wedding for her sweet heart table.\", 'Title: Thinner silverware than most sets you’d buy at store; Content: Quality of this set is a bit cheaper than I wanted. Considering the price was cheaper than other options on amazon thinner/lighter steel was to be expected . Could have gotten a better set from Ross. Quarantine has made online purchases necessary. Otherwise silverware is okay.', 'Title: It is ok.; Content: Not very happy with it. Spoons are too big, and one of the forks bent after one week of use.', 'Title: Nice Set; Content: My spoons have a few little scratches on them', \"Title: Great value but larger spoon is BIG; Content: This set was a great value but the bigger size spoons are BIG. They look kind of ridiculous and my younger kids avoid them. My almost teenager said he likes them for cold cereal. I use them more for serving spoons. I like the feel and weight of these. My old set had heavy handles and would tip over a light bowl. This set is not like that but still feels sturdy. Overall I like it but wish the large spoon wasn't so big that's why I only have it 4 stars.\", 'Title: Good price; Content: Exactly what I expected for the price. Needed more cutlery, after i moved and realized I had tons or butter knifes and only 5 forks and 2 teaspoons. So, ordered this and they’re good quality, good price, overall satisfyied. When i opened the amazon box, the actual box that the product was in, looked kinda old and ripped, so that’s why I didn’t give it 5 stars. Otherwise, these are good for the price point. Nor fancy but are good quality for what i needed.', \"Title: Great set!!; Content: I didn't think I would like the gold color, but I now search the drawer for the pretty gold silverware piece. They are a beautiful color, lightweight and they don't bend when you scoop out your ice cream. ;). 9/21 Update,. I loved this gold silverware. However they are no longer all gold. They have changed colors and are turning a dull goldish silver. Wondering if they are safe to eat from. Not happy\", \"Title: Presentation is impressive, if you dry them immediately after washing; Content: Love the idea of black cutlery. I've gotten some compliments on it. Only drawback is drying spots are very noticeable, if you're letting dry in a dish drainer. Not sure if a dishwasher would remedy that, but I don't have one, and I'm not really into towel- drying dishes! Pros are they're sturdy pieces, and the set is just the right amount for a single person who entertains very infrequently.\", 'Title: Nice; Content: These are nice, I just don’t like the water marks that stay behind or rather, are very visible due to them being the color black. But that’s probably an issue with any other silverware that you’d buy in that color. But definitely recommend !', 'Title: Great purchase for first set of silverware; Content: These are great. Especially for a first set or extra set of silverware. They do have water spots sometimes unless them are washed and dried afterwards.', \"Title: Spoon TOO big, but I’m happy with the rest.; Content: I’m happy with my purchase. Has them for a couple of months, no regrets. They’re not heavy, the only thing I didn’t quite liked is the big spoon, it's so big. Overall I’m happy with my purchase. Would recommend.\", 'Title: Nice set; Content: The set is great, very shining, but a spoon came damaged.', 'Title: Enjoy your meal!; Content: Wow! I was very pleasantly surprised when I received this in the mail. Just by handling the box I realized this is NO set of \"cheapo\" silverware. I purchased it for my grand-daughter who recently moved into her first apartment and was searching for inexpensive silverware. All she had was mis-matched hand-me-downs so this seemed to be a fine starter set for her. She is so thrilled with this and she\\'s even ordered another set. She loves her new silverware set! She and I are impressed by the quality. Great product!', 'Title: Great items for taller folks; Content: If you are looking for utensils for the \"giant\" in your family, these are it. I got these to supplement a set I already had and sadly these are completely different so didn\\'t quite fit the bill. The largest spoon (soup spoon) is huge. It is the exact size of my serving spoon from a older set and the dinner fork tines are as long as my pinky. This would not be an issue but I am 5 ft 3 and everything except my fat fingers are rather small, short and stubby so this fork would probably do me some damage. The smaller salad fork is the same size as my regular dinner fork from another set. I am not saying this is a bad set it is just not meant for petite people. My 6\\' 3\" brother in law would, however, feel much more comfortable with this set. It is beautifully made and a bit heavy so great quality which is why I rate a 5 regardless of my inability to use 1/2 of the set.', \"Title: I love these! Nice size and weight. Comes individually wrapped m; Content: I really like these! Great value for the price. They are not like the average dollar store cutlery. Each piece comes individually wrapped, and the box is easy to store away. I'm pleased with thickness and the weight. Can't go wrong for $13.\", 'Title: Beautiful and sturdy; Content: I was looking for a replacement for our old mismatched silverware but I wanted something different. I bought both the black set and the copper set. They are both great! It feels great in the hand not cheap or flimsy. The finished has held up nicely. My husband washes his cereal spoon right after eating every day. I got both so if can be mixed and matched for special occasions and be really unique. I love how large the salad forks are and my husband likes the large spoons. Mind you, the big fork and spoons are larger than normal and the small is just smaller than your average large. Even our daughter likes the new silverware. The butter knives can really cut, you can see the serrated edge.', 'Title: Great value!; Content: I was so happy with my new cutlery. I was a bit worried they would be crappy since the price was so cheap but I was wrong! They are the right size and heavy! Would highly recommend!', 'Title: That what I was looking for; Content: Looking for some forks and spoons that are not heavy yet sturdy. This set is what I am looking for with the value for $. We use spoon to scope ice-cream. I do have ice-cream scooper but why use another item when a spoon can do the job equally? Save some water bill if using only one item. Anyway, the spoon Did Not bend when I used it to scoop the ice-cream. My previous ones always bend. It does not have design on the handler which make it easier to clean. My previous one has design and extra \"cover\", that were cleaning nightmare. But with smooth surface, I can scrub everything out easily. Highly recommend this product and I DO NOT get any perk from promoting this product.', 'Title: 20 piece silverware set; Content: 20 piece silverware so I got this for my nephew because he got his first apartment and he didn’t have any silverware so I thought as we are a great home warming gift for him these are very sturdy very durable well worth the money would make a great gift for anybody that is getting married or have just got their own apartments highly recommend if anybody’s looking for some high-quality silverware', 'Title: A great set of cutlery!; Content: This set of cutlery is a real bargain. It is so chic and elegant. It looks far more expensive than it it is. It seems very sturdy and well made. I would highly recommend this.This beautiful gold Set of cutlery really enhances the dining experience!', 'Title: Highly recommend; Content: I bought the copper set about a month ago after moving into a new apartment. I\\'ve only owned mismatched, cheap cutlery before, and as a young adult this is my first \"real\" set of silverware. Wasn\\'t sure what to expect, but these are wonderful! They have a good weight to them, seem very sturdy, and the copper color just looks lovely. No sign of wear yet.', \"Title: BEST FLATWARE I'VE EVER OWNED!; Content: This set of flatware is beyond my expectations, but I've always had used/hand-me-downs before! After receiving this 4place setting, I was thrilled with it's appearance & upon washing I was impressed with how easy it was to clean & how great it looked afterward. I'm thrilled to own this cutlery & highly recommend a purchase! Now I'm able to easily entertain AND enjoy my meals!\", \"Title: Quality set; Content: Surprisingly, this is a very good set of silverware. I didn't expect much, but these things have a good weight to them and are very sturdy. The knives especially are very nice; they're very heavy and have a good grip. Very impressed with this, especially for the money.\", 'Title: Thick heavy cutlery; Content: I needed spoons because mine walked away... the spoons are bit large but will work. They are heavy and feel like they’ll last BBC a good while. They feel like Bob Evans/ Cracker Barrel durable.', 'Title: Better Than Expected; Content: These are beautiful for the price tag. I bought a set of Rachael Ray utensils and these are much nicer—they are sturdier, weightier, and have a nice finish. The spoons are wide and great for soup!', 'Title: Great Quality!; Content: I purchased these because we had a spoon/fork shortage in my household. I am convinced someone was either eating them or throwing them away to avoid washing! 🤦\\u200d♀️ These are great quality and super cost effective! Highly recommend!', 'Title: Good for the price; Content: Well worth the price for this beautiful silverware set. I will most definitely gift these for Christmas and housewarming gifts. I highly recommend buying these versus spending a ton of money.', 'Title: Stainless steel; Content: Not bought yet but I see things on here about thickness and stainless. I work with stainless piping and such. Stainless has several grades. Stainless can be magnetic and still be classified as stainless. It says in the description 18/0 stainless . It’s telling you what type it is. Lower grade but still resist rusting pretty well. Very common grade for this. Look up stainless grades and you’ll see to know what you want. Thickness wise. Just as carbon steel stainless can be as thick or as thin as they desire. Ask for the gauge of material. Thicker the better but the price goes up fast. It’s all on interpretation of what’s thick or not. That’s all thanks.', 'Title: They are very heavy n durable.; Content: I love the large size!', 'Title: Gigantesque; Content: These are very big, gigantesque spoons and forks. I don’t recommend.', 'Title: Spoons and forks are HUGE; Content: They are fucken massive good cutlery for a giant.', \"Title: Good enough; Content: Lots of pieces for the money, but the teaspoons are huge and the tabkespoons are the size of cooking spoons. No way a person with an average sized mouth could enjoy cereal or soup using one of these spoons. If you can do better, do better. If it's all you can afford, it'll make do\", 'Title: Table spoons are tooooo big.; Content: The tablespoons are huge too big same size as a serving spoon. Disappointed.', 'Title: Pretty good for the price; Content: I was expecting these to be a bit more solid but the price is right and good enough for when you have lots of guests. The knives and the spoons look high end though. Just the forks could be a bit thicker.', 'Title: Solid Flatware that feels good in your hands; Content: Bought this to replace a set that felt too light and flimsy. I am with holding the final star in that my ideal set would include long handled Teaspoons or at least have a matching ones one could purchase.', \"Title: Great set. But large spoon is huge.; Content: Really sturdy quality set. Looks nice and feels nice. It's just as other reviews say, the spoons are huge. I often serve food with the large spoon and use the small spoon as a regular spoon for eating and soup. This may not end up being my forever set. But it will do for now! Great value.\", \"Title: Growing family; Content: I purchased these as a gift for my daughter and her family. A total of six people in the house. 4 kids. They were eating with 2 households mix match of silverware and most times didn't even have enough for everyone. I didn't want to spend tons of money, but wanted them to have something that had all the pieces for each member of the family. I was very impressed with the quality. My daughter and her family LOVE them! Great value, great quality.\", \"Title: Made big, great set..; Content: So far so good , there made well haven't had any rusting as some can do, the size is unusual they are way bigger than a normal set especially the spoons. I've priced a regular 6 piece setting and they were 20 bucks so this is a good deal. I bought the 60 piece set.\", 'Title: Surprisingly sturdy; Content: Bought this for a vacation home and for the price it is surprisingly sturdy and attractive. Would recommend or buy again. Haven’t used it yet but it won’t be an everyday set all year.', 'Title: ❤️❤️; Content: These are so pretty! I have black stainless steel appliances so these are perfect!!!', \"Title: Better then expected!; Content: This silverware set is better then I expected. I have been searching for a set that was solid but didn't brake the bank. This set met my needs and I'm thinking of ordering another set! Easy to hold and strong. Worth every penny!\", 'Title: Price and quality are excellent!!!; Content: Love the price and quality of these utensils!', \"Title: NOT ACCURATE MEASURING SPOONS; Content: I bought these as a gift and realize after I couldn't return them that these measuring spoons are NOT ACCURATE. The teaspoon is about a gram off of what it should be! If you are a true Baker or cook DON'T BUY THESE! The reviews are good on these spoons and they shouldn't be.\", \"Title: Don't bother; Content: First, it is very misleading when it says that they are engraved with the measurements. They are not. In fact, when I got it it was already missing one of the measurements because it had rubbed off. Imagine after one wash!\", 'Title: Rusting Away.; Content: This is probably the best deal for measuring spoons - 14 for $12. You get stainless steel construction with duel heads, one for dry products and the other for wet. You also get a leveler and five spoons with unorthodox measures: drop, smidgen, pinch, dash, and tad. The main ones are held together by small magnetic blocks. Each has a millimetre equivalent. . . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . . UPDATE: These items were used twice and stored in the kitchen cabinet. Pinholes of rust appeared on four spoons on the inside, outside, and edge. The worst was the 1 teaspoon. There were three rust spots on the inside, one on the outside, and a 1/32\" on the edge. These are constructed of stainless steel, which is rustproof. . . . What is going on?', 'Title: Save your money.; Content: After using these measuring spoons for a couple of weeks, the writing has started to come off of the 1/2 teaspoon. I have not used the 1/8 tsp. It is pictured to help show the difference.', \"Title: Poor quality, horrible odor!; Content: Product arrived with a really odd smell. I barely took it out of the box but was able to detect the odor immediately. It was my fault though that I didn't realize before purchasing that it was made in China. 8 out of 10 times, products made in China have strange odors. The spoons are made from really poor quality steel, it's extremely flimsy. Definitely not recommending this product!\", 'Title: Do not buy; Content: The spoons had rust on them. Also, the magnets are weak.', \"Title: Measurements wearing off spoons.; Content: I bought this item thinking the measurement names would stay on for a very long time. The names are wearing off the spoons already. Wouldn't buy again.\", 'Title: One of the spoon is Reject.; Content: Disappointed. They should inspect if there is damage or reject before they ship to customer.', 'Title: Spoons are good but writing fades off; Content: I just received these measuring spoons a few minutes ago. Unpacked, took a look, packed them back up. The idea of the spoons being magnetic is great. I also like that they are oval as well as round in case one needs to get something straight out of a spice container (i.e. the little Tupperware ones. But..... 2 of the spoons, even though unused and never being exposed to water, already show the measurement that is written on the colored plastic part fading off. I can only imagine what would happen after a few hand washes or even exposure to a dishwasher. So, while the spoons itself are great, one needs to be prepared to memorize what color plastic Mark is what size. I sure cannot do that. It would have been perfect if the measurement has been engraved instead of just printed onto the plastic. What a potty.', \"Title: Measurements were already scratching off when I received them!; Content: The measurements on the magnetic measuring spoons were already starting to scratch off from the friction of the magnets. Seller sent me a new set but the replacements had the exact same problem and then the seller didn't respond to me reaching out after that. Buy from somewhere else and find a set with etched measurements instead of these!\", \"Title: No. Don't buy.; Content: They're magnetic so if you don't put them away perfectly connected in the drawer they spaz out into a huge mess. They are super bendy and not well made. The measurements seem to be different than the ones I currently have in the drawer as well - who knows which are correct.\", \"Title: Weak; Content: Not sturdy at all. These spoons are only ment for dry non pack spices. I didn't even use them after feeling how fragile they are.\", \"Title: Magnets don't work; Content: The magnets on the larger measuring spoons don't work. They won't stay on the refrigerator.\", \"Title: Rust; Content: I use these to measure out Seachem Safe for my aquarium. After a week or twos use, they started to oxidize. Whether it is due to moisture, Safe or just poor steel quality I don't know, but it is pretty disappointing. Wash and dry them well after each use!\", 'Title: measurement/writing wears off fast.....; Content: the measurement/writing on spoons wears off very easy.... mine wore off in 5 months, and i never use them that much....', \"Title: Rusting after first wash; Content: I really like these. I especially like the really small spoons that measure a pinch, dash, etc. The major problem I have, and the reason for the 3 star review, is that after only one wash they are already starting to rust. This is incredibly disappointing and I will have to remember to wash and immediately dry them as you would a knife moving forward. You can't just put these in the dishwasher or even hand wash them and set them on a drying mat/rack.\", 'Title: Good Quality INITIALLY; Content: These measuring spoons are of excellent quality. I love the double sided feature where I can now fit the spoon into spice bottles without having to pour it all over the counter - and at the cost of spices - each grain saved is \"money in the bank\". Despite the magnetic ability to hold onto everything in the utensil drawer - the great advantage is that I can remove them as a single group and since many recipes require many sets of measurements using various spoons, I have them all ready to go, without having to go back to the drawer and search for a specific spoon for the next ingredient. The annotations are easy to read with the one exception of the spoon with yellow on white - which takes some squinting to read. But that is a minor inconvenience. So to sum it up - good quality, good price, and VERY convenient. UPDATE: I had ti change my rating from 5 to 3 stars because - after a few months of use the writing on several of the spoons which show the measurement have faded to a point where they can no longer be read. We have had to write up a separate card to link the color of the spoon to its size.', 'Title: You get what you pay for; Content: I like the idea behind this product, but the magnets are very weak, and the spoons themselves are flimsy (the stainless steel is thin). Very cool that each spoon measures the same volume but one end is narrow to fit in a small opening (like a spice jar). Would have paid more for a heavier thickness of stainless steel if I had known.', \"Title: Not good quality; Content: These spoons are not made well. I was worried I might actually get cut on the metal since they seem so unfinished. It's great that there are so many spoons with different measuring units which is why I purchased & the double sided is also ingenious but the quality is so bad that I returned them. Was disappointed, would have loved to keep these if they were better built.\", 'Title: Love the dual scoops!; Content: This is a great set with a wide array of sizes and dual scoops! The only challenge I have had is when you grab one, you grab them all! The magnets in the handles are pretty strong and it is sometimes a nuisance.', 'Title: Just ok; Content: These measuring spoons bend awful easily.', 'Title: Soft spoons; Content: These are soft metal and bend easily in peanut butter', \"Title: Incorrect Measurements; Content: I haven't checked all of these but I can say for certain that the Tablespoon is not the right size at all! It is less than it should be. I have tried several other old tablespoons that I have just to verify because it didn't seem right. If the tablespoon doesn't measure correctly then I wonder about the rest. I'm sending them back. I don't think the Chinese know our measurements or how to properly size them.\", 'Title: A small flaw, great overall.; Content: I like this set a lot. However, I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the measurements are already wearing off after being washed so frequently. I find this to be a problem with a lot of manufactures when it comes to measuring spoons. If the measurements were etched on, these would be perfect!', 'Title: Nice set but a bit messy; Content: These are very nice measuring spoons especially since they have the double ends with a narrow spoon on one end to get into small openings. The magnets holding them together are sort of weak, they come apart in the drawer plus they want to attach to everything else in the drawer or sink.', \"Title: Very happy with the quality, appearance, and convenience. Love the mini spoons.; Content: I bought this set mostly for the mini spoons. I have been looking for a good quality set with actual numerical measurements on them: 1/64 tsp, 1/32 tsp, 1/16 tsp, …. The quaint 'olde-tymey' names mean nothing to me. There were only a few sets available that showed pictures with numbers on them but they looked like cheap aluminum, and worse, upon inquiry of the sellers I learned that the actual ones they were shipping did not have the numbers at all. Excuse me? After four inquiries to this seller–Wildone–I was able to verify that these spoons are made from 18/0 stainless steel and the numbers ARE on the mini spoons. I got the order in a day and was impressed with the quality. The spoons are all stamped magnetic stainless steel. The numerals on the mini spoons are cleanly stamped deeply and clearly enough for maximum legibility. The cheap ones of other sellers have very shallow barely legible numerals, if any. The color-coded plastic plaques on the larger spoons are OK and the numerals are large and contrast well with the colors, but after the first dishwasher wash, there is already some fading as others have mentioned. I won't do that again. The magnets are strong but not so strong that they are hard to separate. I fanned out the spoons to make it easier to take out the size I want. The mini spoons come on a split ring which makes it hard to separate them. The bowls get locked together and require a fingernail to separate them. So I added small magnets to them to make them as convenient as the large spoons. See images for details.\", 'Title: Works well except the writing rubs off...; Content: First, I have never scientifically tested if the portions are actually correct but from what I can tell they are accurate. They work great, the magnets keep it nice and tidy, and I love that there are two sides to each number (allows me twice the use / multiple ingredients especially if some are wet and some are dry). The main \"qualm\" I have is that the writing that tells you the measurement is starting to rub off! I\\'m not washing/scrubbing them excessively hard and I don\\'t often put them in the dishwasher. So I may have to write the measurements in Sharpie if it fades more... Other than that, they\\'re great for the price.', 'Title: They work; Content: I had a ragtag collection of measuring spoons leftover from previous sets. I was happy to get this set although I kept my old ones too. I like that there are two spoon heads on each size, one for liquids and one to get into spice jars. What would I do differently? I would have added a 2 tablespoon spoon and a 2 teaspoon spoon. I cook and bake a lot so that would have made these perfect. But honestly, they are fine and I am glad to have bought them.', 'Title: Easy to Store; Content: I like the two shapes of measuring spoons for different jars, but I noticed that they are a bit flimsy. If you are measuring something against the side of a jar or canister, the middle of the handle will bend. They could be made a bit stronger.', 'Title: Two spoons marked incorrectly; Content: The picture indicates that the one teaspoon is only 1/2 teaspoon, and also that the 1/2 teaspoon is a one teaspoon. So, they are marked incorrectly both in the picture, AND in the actual set I received. I still kept them, I just corrected each with a sharpie... because I liked the set and strong magnet overall. From the other comments, it looks like the measure wears off eventually anyway.', 'Title: seem sturdy enough; Content: What drew me to this set is the few extra spoons with word based measures related to those I heard growing up (tad, pinch, dab, etc...). Using magnets to organize the common spoons seems like a good idea. These should replace all our other spoons of mixed manufacture and design.', \"Title: Compact organized measuring spoons.; Content: Very satisfying to have a set that keeps itself in one place so I don't have to hunt the drawer for random measuring spoons. Very happy with this set and recommend it to anyone needing organization and space saving items.\", \"Title: Cute and useful!; Content: I love that they are double-sided and that they stick together. I just wish they were a little stronger. I bent one measuring refrigerated beef base. Fortunately, I noticed immediately so it didn't bend very much but my other spoons have been able to scoop it without bending. But overall i am happy with them.\", 'Title: Good product; Content: Excellent! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the leveler is not the best. I hoped it would level out the formula I use for my twins, instead of using my fingers, but it doesn’t work that well. Otherwise, they stick together well and go right in the dishwasher', 'Title: Gave it 3 stars because tablespoon needs stronger magnet.; Content: Tablespoon magnet not strong enough to support the weight & keeps falling off my refrigerator door.', 'Title: I like them so much I bought a second set; Content: I love these measuring spoons! They arrived in a timely fashion and look exactly as they are advertised on Amazon. They are very sturdy. I love that I can use just the spoon I need and wash only that one spoon I used (instead of washing all of my plastic spoons when I used only one spoon as they are held together with a ring). They are always all together in my kitchen drawer with a strong magnet. And each spoon has a narrow end for spice jars and a round end for liquids. I like them so much I bought a second set for my daughter. She loves to bake and uses them daily. I can recommend this spoon set without reservation.', 'Title: Double sided and magnetic features are amazing; Content: I love these! I somehow lost one of the spoons from my previous set of measuring spoons, so I ordered these as a replacement. The two-sides feature is so useful. It’s great to have a skinny spoon to fit in spice jars, but I’ve found that it’s also incredibly useful to have two of the same measurement for recipes that have both wet and dry ingredients of the same measurement. I was a little skeptical/unsure of the magnetic middle, but I’ve really enjoyed this feature. It’s so much easier than trying to thread spoons back onto a ring. **note that there is a 1/2 Tablespoon measurement. I’ve never had that spoon, and I hadn’t noticed it in the bunch. I accidentally used it in place of my 1/2 teaspoon the other day. Oops! I’m also excited to have a 1/8 teaspoon, as my old set didn’t have that one, but I have a recipe that calls for 1/8.', \"Title: Great selection of sizes with the bonus of not getting scattered.; Content: Love the range of sizes, the fact that these are magnetic make them both space saving and easy to find in messing kitchen drawers. They're dishwasher safe and the color codes make it easy for people with vision problems.\", 'Title: Great for tiny measurements; Content: I needed a set of measuring spoons with smaller measurements. I like these very much due to the smaller units. The narrow end of the spoon is supposed to easily go into a spice bottle. I had some issues with that. But I managed and things worked out ok. I used a smaller spoon to dip out into the correct sized spoon. The magnetics are great for putting them all into a place of storage. But to drop them into a sink presented me with a problem of my silverware being stuck to the measuring spoons. But otherwise they are great if you need smaller measurements.', 'Title: Cleaver Design; Content: Since I’ve been self isolating at home with three teenagers I’ve been cooking and baking every day, so I wanted to treat myself to a few new kitchen gadgets. I liked the look of these spoons, and I had never seen measuring spoons like these before. The magnetic feature is great because you can pull them apart while using instead of them being stuck together on a ring, and there’s a round side for liquids & a narrow side for accommodating spice jars. Very cleaver design. I will get plenty of use out of these. A good purchase for the price', 'Title: Excellent quality; Content: Love this item, very sturdy material, excellent quality and workmanship. Magnet is strong and they stay together well. Added bonus is each measurement also shows the conversion into ml. I’ll never use the (smaller) additional pinch and dash measurement spoons but they are of the same quality, no magnet but super cute to have.', 'Title: Perfect. Highly recommend.; Content: I love these and use them daily. They are less clunky than ones attached with a ring. They are definitely the most used measuring spoons I have now. Being able to measure two different things with the same measurement without having to stop and clean it is great.', \"Title: Good product; Content: The magnets seem weak at first but do a good job holding everything together. The colors are not quite what is pictured, a little more sickly, but they're not ugly. Overall they do exactly what I need them to do, go through the dishwasher just fine, and take up less space. Good product.\", 'Title: Nice assortment of measurements for wet and dry measuring; Content: I like the way the measuring spoons stack and stay together with the magnets. The narrow end is great for fitting inside spice bottles. The smaller non magnetic spoons are very helpful for measuring out tiny amounts of medications and supplements for my small pets. I have other sets of the magnetic spoons that I bought a few years ago but they came with less spoon sizes. All my sets stack together and stay nicely organized. I use them constantly.', 'Title: Particularly versatile measuring spoons; Content: I got really tired of looped together measuring spoons. Use one wash them all. These are great because have two of each size on one spoon. Very well made. Metal but not aluminum. They get washed one at a time. Well marked easy to grab correct size. Pretty. The magnets do work to stack and keep them together but I keep them loose in a glass so can just grab one.', 'Title: Wonderful-magnitized & says together in drawer; Content: LOVE THESE SPOONS! The set come with the \"pinch, dash\" spoons. During Quarantine Co-19 & all our baking, another set of spoons come in handy. The untit is magnetized & stays together as a unit in the drawer. Wonderful set.', 'Title: The Best Measuring Spoons I Own; Content: Best Measuring Spoons I own & I have 4 sets. I love that they are two sided, perfect when I’m baking. The fact that they are magnetic is a Added plus, they stay organized in my drawer and are easy to fine. These would make a perfect little gift to friends & family.', \"Title: Double-sided and they stay together - perfect for me!; Content: I can't stand keeping my measuring cups and spoons connected together at the handle - it's a pain. The rings that are easy to open and close always break, and the ones that are sturdy pretty much punish you for wanting to separate a spoon from the group. These magnetic spoons eliminate that problem. I love that they have the oval and round shapes, so they fit into small-mouthed jars, too. I honestly can't believe I am this excited about some measuring spoons, but I've been in the house for a *while*...\", \"Title: Fancy!; Content: These are great if you bake often and need accurate measurements. I really like the oval option that fit inside the spice jars. This also comes with a leveler if you want to be really accurate (that's not me, but maybe you). The ones I replaced we're plastic and the measurements wore off so my son wouldn't help me because he didn't know what was what. We won't have that problem with these!\", \"Title: So many sizes, and they don't get lost in the drawer; Content: I bought a set of these spoons for my daughter and one for me. I love that it has unusual measures like 1/2 tablespoon and 1/16 teaspoon. The magnets keep them from getting separated and lost in the drawer. The colors on the handles make them easy to see if half of them take off on a side trip. The leveler is a nice addition. They are sturdy and seem like they will last a long time.\", 'Title: Very Convenient; Content: When I ordered these I sort of scratched my head about having the same measurement on both ends, But it turned out that I love it! Having the option of an oval or a circular spoon helps a lot when you have to dip into a narrow spice jar. I hope eventually I will memorize the colors for the size, because the labeling is not always easy to read without my glasses.', 'Title: Sturdy magnet so they stay together in the drawer; Content: I love every feature of these spoons. I’m too through with my old measuring spoons and digging for the right spoon size because they are not connected, or washing the whole set after using just one spoon because they are connected. These have a sturdy magnet so they stay together in the drawer. Double sided is so convenient and I love the level tool. I have bought 4 more sets as gifts.', 'Title: Well Made Measuring Spoons; Content: I have had the kitchen aid plastic measuring spoons for a long time. When I saw these magnetic spoons I really liked the design. Finally purchased and they are amazing. The magnets keep the spoons together well when stored but are easy to pull apart. I love that they stand up on the counter. The thinner side is also great to get into spice jars. I’ve had them a few months and they have help up very well with consistent use and going through the dishwasher.', \"Title: They keep the drawer tidy; Content: Love these measuring spoons! I like how they nest and don't spew all over the drawer. Makes them easier to find. My other loose measure spoons are attracted to them also, which is no big deal. The long end makes it so much easier to stick inside a spice tin and pull out leveled. I'd recommend them. I hand wash them. Easy to clean, too.\", \"Title: Exactly as expected; Content: These are a great set of measuring spoons. The volume seems accurate, and they don't oxidize in the dishwasher. I would recommend them. We had previously purchased some plastic ones, but they began to melt in the dishwasher over time. I would like to see a smaller one added for the pinch, and dash sizes, but they are great and I knew what sizes were coming when I ordered it.\", 'Title: No knives! No dinner forks! Open box!; Content: So disappointing! Set arrived with NO KNIVES and NO dinner forks. I’d intended to give the flatware set as a Christmas gift to a grandchild moving into first apartment. Package was a mess. Box was open and outer wrap had a big hole on one side. No wonder pieces were missing!', 'Title: Poor quality and scratches are seen; Content: Although it was well packed, and individually put inside a plastic wrap, I could see scratches on the spoons and forks already.', 'Title: Rusty Knives; Content: Theses arrived on April 12 and I waited to open/use them. Today, May 22, I noticed a substantial amount of rust on several of the knives. These are obviously not stainless steel... but I guess for the price, I should have guessed that. Also, they are all so small- like forks and spoons for ants! So if you want tiny silverware that lasts a month, this is your go-to! Otherwise, maybe just spend the extra money for something that will last.', \"Title: Not happy; Content: The handle doesn't look slim like the picture does. Spoons are bulky not appealing\", 'Title: Ok, but appear cheap.; Content: Fine for budget dinnerware, but these are visibly cheaper than my other utensils. Very lightweight, and very small. The large sizes are just about the same size as the smalls of my other sets. Fine on a budget, but I wouldn’t want to use these for hosting guests.', 'Title: Ok quality for price but could use a little tweaking; Content: They were nice and sturdy. But the handle of the knives are to heavy and make them feel out of balance. But overall still a good quality', \"Title: Fine. Tiny forks. Sharp knives.; Content: So these are fine, stainless, fine in dishwasher. Dirt cheap so I bought a 2nd set to solve my fork problem (see below). I like the sharp knives. Don't need to have separate steak knives now (well idk haven't tried it on actual steak yet but fine for chicken). The forks are not Lg and Sm. They're Sm and Tiny. The one they call a salad fork is about the size of a shrimp cocktail fork just with 4 tines. The one they call large is what I would call a salad fork. I thought I'd be fine with having 8 total forks, whatever I'll use small ones no prob, but I had to get a 2nd set because 4 of the forks (the tiny ones) are nearly useless. So, now I will have 8 salad forks. Which I'm fine with, not a huge fan of big forks anyway. The knife handle is great. The rest of the handles are not like that. They're not rounded on the edges, and are a 90degree corner. Not quite sharp but not smooth. They need to file those down. Whatever. I'd have gotten a $20 set from the start if I knew about the forks. Not gonna bother returning (unpacked and washed and tossed everything already before I noticed), that's why I decided to just get another set. But all in all this isn't that upsetting. They're durable - I don't think the spoons will bend when you're scooping Ice Cream or anything. And they don't look like they have a cheap plating on them. For $10 they're fine.\", 'Title: Good overall; Content: Outside of the forks and spoons being lighter than the knives these are what I was looking for. The knives are nicely weighted I was just looking for forks and spoons that had a little more weight as well.', 'Title: Nice set; Content: Absolutely the right amount of flat wear for a single guy ! They look expensive! The weight is perfect 😍 and the length is great Value for the money is excellent Sturdiness is amazing Durable smooth for soups', \"Title: Check before you unwrap; Content: I bought 2 sets. I was busy cooking so I let my kids unwrap everything. As I was washing I noticed there was no knives. So now that they have been opened and washed I can't send back. So I have a ton of spoons and forks and no knives. It's my own fault for not checking but I'm 100% positive they were supposed to have knives in them.\", 'Title: Excellent value... worth every cent.. BEWARE OF SHARPER THAN THE NORM BUTTERKNIVES!; Content: Absolute value for the $, 100%, & would buy again & WILL be buying my daughter who just moved into her own place, a set. Not flimsy, solid & durable (can’t lie I was borderline shocked at this) & wash up very well. The ONLY issue I have is the butter knifes.... a HUGE be forewarned to anyone who is thinking of purchasing... my daughter straight sliced the tip of her finger off one of those. I took a pic to better describe just how serrated the tops of knives are! Use caution... dinnerware & lethal objects in one🤣 5 stars... very happy with it regardless!!', 'Title: Silver ware; Content: Very happy with silver ware set pieces are very sturdy nothing has bent or broken very good value for the price', 'Title: No rust, no fuss; Content: It’s been a month and I’m still very impressed with this set. This flatware set doesn’t bend; it’s thick and durable enough for my needs. My biggest concern before buying this product were the reviews that mentioned rust. I don’t know if I got lucky or what, but I do not see any rust after a month of dishwasher use, almost every day. I shopped around for a good, inexpensive product, and I’m really happy with my purchase. One thing that I’ve noticed, is with the knives, they have a pointed tip. My previous knives were rounded at the tip, so now when I am get cream cheese or peanut butter from a plastic jar, the tip of the knife scrapes against the container, which just takes some getting use to after years of having rounded knives. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.', \"Title: Very Comfortable!; Content: We desperately needed new silverware. When I saw this set and read the reviews, this set was exactly what I was looking for. I'd recommend and purchase again.\", \"Title: I'm so impressed!; Content: I just gotten my silverware today . I honestly thought for $20.00 I would be getting junk...not the case I'm so impressed. They are very heavy , very good quality . I only needed a few pieces so thought I'd try these only based on the other reviews . I would buy again\", 'Title: THIS is TOTALLY Worth The Money!; Content: I bought this as an extra set for when I have a large dinner party and THIS is an amazon secret!! This is real bang for your buck! Sixty pieces of stainless steel cutlery, simple lines, very neat and clean- less that $30??!! In 2021? UNHEARD OF!!! If you have. vacation home this is a MUST BUY for you. I am getting tired of serving a crowd of adults for dinner using plastic cutlery. As adults it is time to use REAL cutlery and elegant disposable plates. This cutlery set is WORTH IT!!!', 'Title: Absolutely awesome for the price; Content: So I bought these for $20 bucks on sale through woot. I was expecting something along the lines of dollar store special and was quite surprised when I received them. They’re not like a $100 plus high end set of flatware but then again they’re far superior to what I expected to receive for the price. Great deal would buy again if I ever expected to need another set!', \"Title: What?!?!?!?!; Content: Why are people paying a ridiculous amount for silverware when these exist? The butter knives are super sharp...almost like steak knives. I've have only washed them in the dishwasher (with non-lemon scented detergent, lemon scented can cause rusting) and haven't had any issue with rusting. Super cheap. They're basic in terms of aesthetic but ill sacrifice it just to save that much money.\", 'Title: Great and heavy set; Content: Bought these to replace my mismatchy stuff and get a real full set. Love these. They are nice and heavy and the butter knives are sharper than the dull ones I had before which is nice for cutting without needing a steak knife for some foods. Overall, will probably buy one more set just to have for when we have extra people.', \"Title: Sturdy weighted but not too heavy; Content: I actually love these they look and feel more expensive and I would recommend them I haven't had them long enough to determine whether they will rust I've seen some photos where some have I suggest that you not let them sit in water and dry them when you're finish washing them to avoid any rusting but they shouldn't rust at all....but we shall see 😊\", \"Title: Better than expected!; Content: When I opened the package, I had expected some flatware that would be a couple steps down from this. I was surprised to find that they are decent. After several cycles through our dishwasher they show no signs of wear. They aren't super nice, but for the money, they are much better than I expected. I'm happy with both the finish, and the nice weight in the hand.\", 'Title: Strong; Content: I was surprised how sturdy and durable these were. I felt the price was on point. Quality seems really good as well. I bought these while imbetween moving and my storage unit: I had a much expensive set in storage and I actually think these are just as nice.', \"Title: Heavy Duty, But Lightweight; Content: So far so good! They feel nice and sturdy and fairly heavy duty, but yet light enough to hold in your hand without feeling weighed down. Very comfortable to hold in your hand, felt natural. Set as a whole in the box was heavy, but individually they're lightweight. Washed them right away in the dishwasher and with my jet dry, they came out spotless! Very simple but pretty set of silverware for a GREAT price.\", \"Title: Perfectly weighted & great shine, I'm ordering more!; Content: I am VERY pleasantly surprised with the quality of these! They actually feel luxurious due to having that perfect weight. Heavy enough they actually feel expensive (!!)but light enough to not be obnoxious. I'll be ordering another set actually. Shine is great & held up well in the dishwasher ! Excellent bang for your buck\", \"Title: Good Value; Content: This was a good value simple silverware set. I'm glad I went with this one versus something more trendy. It works with everything and all the pieces are still in good shape 5 months after buying the set.\", 'Title: Ot bad for the price; Content: I bought these to use at parties instead of plastic. They are nicer and sturdier than I expected. If you’re looking for good quality at a good price, these fit the bill', \"Title: Great value!; Content: This set exceeded my expectations. I couldn't believe how nice it was for the price. We bought 3 sets for our large family and have been using them for about 6 months now. They came nice and shiny, and by now they are a little scratched up with wear, but I would expect that from any set. I would buy these again for sure.\", 'Title: Good combo/price; Content: The circle shapes on the silicone are too smaller, really are not useful for piping macarons.', \"Title: RUST!!!; Content: Seller stated they are rust free BUT THEY ARE NOT!! This is my second set (replaced first due to rust too!!!) And couldn't find anywhere to contact seller!\", 'Title: These are great; Content: I love these! The price is good and I’ve had no issues with them. I don’t use them in the dishwasher just in case because of the rubber on the bottom of them, I don’t want it to melt.', 'Title: Good knives; Content: Super happy with these! I live in a small town and the only place for me to buy knives was at the dollar store...they kept breaking 🙄 These work great!', 'Title: Pouring is a little difficult! Overall great containers!; Content: I really like these containers and how they are setup but I wish there was a better way when pouring ingredients into the measuring cup! Overall they are great!', \"Title: Nice measurement set.; Content: 21 Pcs Stainless Steel Measuring Cups and Spoons Set, Wildone Stackable Metal Measuring Cups and Spoons for Cooking & Baking, Includes 7 Cups, 9 Spoons and 5 Mini Spoons（Black） I really like idea of this set, having off-sized measurements such as 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup, and the mini spoons are very handy! All of the sets fit together well, and have those cool little clips so the cups and spoons don't want to run around all over a drawer, and the sets are very efficient on space. The solid construction and stamped measurements are excellent features as well, ones that I look for and choose when I can. However, I noticed that the paint on the handles of some of the cups where they go on the clip is already starting to flake and chip. It's only very small areas, but it does give me pause to wonder how well the coating will hold up over time. Overall I like this set, and hope that they hold up with time and use.\", \"Title: Very pleased; Content: I love the variety of spoon and cup measures. They are easy to clean and I like the black metal instead of the standard silver or plastic I've always owned. Made well, priced good.\", 'Title: Even has the hard-to-find spoon sizes; Content: Everything you need and then some! Attractive black finish and heavier weight than I was expecting. Expecting these to last many, many years.', 'Title: What I was looking for; Content: A study set of measures tools that are easy to clean and durable. All my plastic ones are gone. They are easy to read. So far these cups and spoons has delivered what they promised.', 'Title: They are not stainless steel as claimed here!!; Content: They are Chrome plated!!', 'Title: Spoons are incorrectly/inconsistently marked.; Content: The 1/2 tablespoon is marked as a 1/2 teaspoon. I attempted to contact the seller about this but there does not seem to be a way to contact them directly. Sending them an email through amazon fails due to \"a problem with the recipient\\'s email system.\" The spoons that are correctly marked inconsistent as well. The 1 tablespoon is the only one with a capital T in Tbsp, all other tablespoon measurements use a lowercase t in tbsp. This is not as big of an issue, but it is a red flag that this is a low-quality product without much thought or care put into it. Would not recommend.', 'Title: Handles not that sturdy!; Content: I would pass on these if I were you. We thought we would like these so the box they came in was recycled. Unfortunately, the liquid measuring cups are no as sturdy as they claim...your fingers will push right through the whole in the handle. This happened numerous times with them. The labels are oftentimes hard to read for us, but not as hard as plastic ones where the numbers wash off. I wouldn’t say it’s a horrible buy, but these will be donated based on the poor construction, in my opinion. If you’re okay with the silicone being dislodged every time...I guess it is a good thing to ensure any debris are cleaned from the grooves <shrug> but not worth it to us.', 'Title: Measuring spoon not marked correctly!!!!; Content: Past the return date, but I just realized there are (TWO) 1/2 tsp. Measuring spoons. The bigger one should be either 1/2 TBSP. Or 1 1/2 TSP...it took a couple of ruined baking attempts before I realized the spoons were marked incorrectly. I should be able to RETURN them at any time for that reason!', 'Title: Close but no cigar; Content: This is an updated review. As seen below, when I received these I thought the material looked to be \"reasonably solid\". However, I just used the one cup measure for maybe the 2nd or 3rd time and as I went to wash it I noticed that the side is cracked and bowed out (almost like a little pouring indentation). So that one is going in the trash. Disappointing. I\\'ve never had this kind of problem with any other measuring cups. I have other metal measuring cups but the sizes are hard to read so that is why I bought these. Fortunately I still have the old one. The material seems reasonably solid. Two major reasons I orders were the shape of the measuring spoons and the color coding. Now that I have them I will use (some of) them. But I won\\'t be ordering them as a Christmas gift for my sons, which had been the plan. The reasons are as follows: 1. While the size is engraved on each handle, it\\'s smaller and harder to see than I had hoped. 2. Labeling is not consistent. The 1/2 Tablespoon is written as 1/2 tbsp. Typically (and on other Tablespoon spoons in the set) the T is capitalized for tablespoons so I found this to be confusing. 3. The biggest problem is actually the color coding that had attracted me in the first place. This is accomplished through a silicone insert that adds substantially to the thickness of the handle. This makes nesting impossible and even trying to manipulate around the ring very difficult. Fortunately the silicone insert is easy to remove, which is exactly what I have done for the measuring spoons. When taken out there is a nice big oval so they fit on a ring and are easily handled to get to the one I want. I took the cup measurers off the ring and pulled out the sizes I use most often. Maybe I\\'ll find a use for all the other sizes someday but at this point I feel that the extra sizes did more for increasing the cost than for helping me cook. Bottom line: I will use these but they don\\'t provide the ease of use I was hoping for so I don\\'t recommend them.', 'Title: Inaccurately labeled and watch the ends; Content: Pretty right? They are. Pretty annoying that is. As seen in the picture you can see that several of the spoons are wrongly or confusingly labled. Those bright colors are rubber inserts that will, over time, collect mold and need clean separately. But the most annoying part? The edges of the handles are as sharp as Mel Brooks in his heyday. While they havent made me bleed, they get the point across: do not buy.', \"Title: bend easy; Content: I didn't like these because they bend really easily. I was scooping a thing of flour out and handle popped out the color part in Bent. I did love the spoons but it wasn't worth keeping them.\", 'Title: Wrong size imprint; Content: The 1/2 Tbsp or 1 1/2 tsp, as the case may be, is erroneously labeled. Unfortunately, I purchased this set over a month ago.... I will see if a local engraver can add a 1 in front of the 1/2 tsp to correct error. There is no one to contact, customer support is not available.', \"Title: measures mis-marked!; Content: at least one of the spoon measures is mismarked. The plastic color is already lifting off. I'm sending this to Goodwill. and purchasing something I can trust.\", \"Title: DO NOT BUY! Wrong measurements; Content: Measurements are incorrect on a couple of the spoons 1/2 tsp and others. After reading reviews doesn't seem like they are going to fix this. Looks like this has been an issue for 2 years....\", 'Title: Not Labeled Correctly! Booo!; Content: These measuring spoons are not accurately labeled which is confusing to the young cooks in my house.', 'Title: Spoons marked wrong; Content: Some of the measuring spoons have the wrong measurement size on them. Returning.', 'Title: Beware of measurements; Content: Both spoons are labeled 1/2 tsp...', 'Title: spoon has wrong measure on it; Content: This set would be fantastic except for 1 thing: the 1 1/2 tsp measuring spoon says 1/2 tsp. The ml marking is approx correct (says 7.5 ml, but 1.5 tsp is closer to 7.4 ml). I spent a lot of time shopping for these and was delighted with the thickness, sturdiness, and shape. Those qualities are a \"5\". But, there was no rating for accuracy. Couldn\\'t believe the marking was wrong! I contacted the seller and they offered to send me a set of replacement measuring spoons. Thinking that the first set was a fluke, I ordered another set as a gift. It has the same issue that the 1 1/2 tsp measuring spoon is marked as 1/2 tsp. I contacted them again....will change my rating if this gets straightened out. My crazy rating of 1 is so that people will read this review!', 'Title: Spoons labeled wrong; Content: The measurements were labeled wrong on the spoons! I ended up sending these back. The colored rubber part on both the spoons and the cups was not fully stuck onto the items. I feared that after a few washings it would begin to tear off. I wanted to love these because they are beautiful. But the quality is very poor.', \"Title: Mislabeled Measuring Spoons; Content: A lot of the measuring spoons are mislabeled as to what their size actually is. For me that wasn't a big deal, because I could figure out which was which. However, when my husband uses them he does what any normal person would and checks the label of the quantity. Overall, super sturdy, love the shape and heft. But disappointed by the mislabeling. Also, it kind of feels like you're a janitor with all of them on a single metal ring clanking about.\", 'Title: I do NOT like these at all; Content: Yes they are just measuring cups but I though these based on the picture they would nestle into each other better. They take up a ton of room. The silicone on the ends prevents them from really nesting into each other and make them space saving. The measuring spoons are the absolute worst for the same reason. If you dont mind the are decent measuring cups/spoons. There functionality as just measuring cups and spoons is totally fine. Space saving.... hard no.', \"Title: Could be Better.; Content: I like that it has different measurements. The bad things are: The colored silicone on the handle rips easily. The edges of the cups are somewhat sharp. The handles soldering is bad. I didn't return it because I've not been able to find a set with similar number of measurements... otherwise I would have return it.\", \"Title: Bulkiness outweighs usefulness; Content: I was attracted to these pieces because of the unique measurement increments and shapes. But they are so bulky that they dominate my utensil drawer and the clutter is frustrating. I found the measurements on the spoons and cups themselves difficult to read (and I'm not that old). While they seemed like a good idea, they ultimately weren't very useful.\", 'Title: Disappointed; Content: OMG this cups won’t comply with the quality described. The biggest cup it cracked.', 'Title: Good thought, poor execution.; Content: Liked overall quality, spoons and cups are mislabelled. I can look and tell the difference between a tablespoon and a teaspoon but wondered about younger chefs. The 4 tablespoon that is labeled 4 teaspoon has problem with silicone not bring secured, two pieces are sticking up awaway from handle and back of spoon is short of silicone.', 'Title: Not sturdy; Content: Had these about 7 months and they are starting to crack. I hand wash them so I’m not sure how this happened. Not really worth the money.', \"Title: Not very sturdy; Content: These are not as sturdy as I wanted. I like the shape but I've already bent handles just scooping out sugar.\", 'Title: The spoons are labeled incorrectly; Content: This is very odd... Please see the photo. The pink is correct and the blue should read 1/2 TBSP... Please send me the correct measuring spoon. Thank you!', 'Title: Missed the mark; Content: The 1/2 Tablespoon is labeled 1/2 tsp', 'Title: Durable measuring spoons; Content: These measuring spoons/cups are very durable and heavy duty, easy to read, and pretty to look at. My only complaint is that the silicone handles on them make them hard to spin on the ring, so you have to work to use different one while keeping them on the ring.', 'Title: The measurements I need!; Content: I wanted a set of measuring spoons and cups with a variety of measurements. This set fits the bill. I need to cut so many recipes in half and these measurements have those half-sizes. I ordered two sets. Love them. Recommend them to everyone who really cooks. The handle on the measuring cups might need to be a bit sturdier, but that is the only complaint I have and it would not prohibit me from purchasing them.', 'Title: Great but there is a typo; Content: These measuring cups and spoons are sturdy and have a nice soft grip. However, there is a typo. They confused tsp with tbs or tbsp one one spoon.', 'Title: Love the spoons but one spoon was labeled/marked wrong.; Content: There were two spoons labeled \"1/2 tsp\"; however, one was much larger than the other. I believe the larger spoon of the two should have been marked as the 1/2 tablespoon. There is no spoon labeled 1/2 tablespoon in my set. Otherwise I love my measuring spoons.', 'Title: It’s good overall; Content: The top part of the measuring cups are a bit sharp. The soft silicone handles come off and it’s hollow inside them.', 'Title: Measuring cups; Content: I really like them. Like the handles, etc', 'Title: Perfect imho; Content: This is the measuring CUP & SPOON set I have been looking for! Buy the RECTANGULAR set instead of the ROUND set...The rectangular ones are all narrow & can easily fit into spice jars whereas in the round set the measuring spoon part gets wider & wider & won’t fit into many slim jars. I’v had solid metal sets before but when baking/cooking I now prefer a more substantial handle. Love the super soft & smooth silicone handles..great for giving a good grip while baking. Absolutely love the variety of colors. Very vibrant colors...can easily grab your 1Tbsp spoon quickly once you get familiar w/the colors. Comes w a bonus leveler & mini (super small!) whisk which was nice. Both sets came zip tied & in plastic bags & looked new. The measuring amounts are ENGRAVED in the handles so they won’t rub away like older sets I’ve owned which then become basically useless.', \"Title: Nice set of measuring tools in large variety of sizes; Content: I selected these because of the color coded silicone handles. Often I'm trying to grab a measuring cup or spoon quickly and the color coding makes it easier to find instead of having to try to read fine print on the handles. I am transitioning from plastic measuring tools and I like the sturdy feel of these. They are super cute with the lively colored handles. I really love the rectangular shape of the spoons since they fit into spice jars, salt container etc. as opposed to the traditional round shape. My one complaint is that the smaller measuring cups do not stand on their own, they fall over which is understandable due to the length of the handle, but it would have been nice if they did.\", \"Title: Finally a set with all the odd sizes...; Content: It is so difficult to find a good set of measuring cups that include all of the odd sizes as well. I love to cook and bake and I am always using multiple sets of measuring cups. It is always my odd sized ones that I never have enough. These are a very sturdy set. There are a couple things that I noticed that aren't a big issue. The center silicone inserts on the handles feel like they move around and may eventually fall out. The openings on these silicone parts make it a bit difficult to slide off and on the ring that they come with. Because of this, I am considering just throwing the ring away and just stacking them. I love the measuring spoons. They are also solid and include the odd sizes. I have the same complaint with the ring on these. This will be more difficult to take the ring off of. No big deal, but just something to note. These do tend to get stuck together and they are a tight fit, so you do have to pry them apart. But again, I love the odd sizes, so it is a minor inconvenience. I love the rectangular shape of these spoons too because they fit more easily in all of my spice jars and baking soda/powder boxes. Overall, I highly recommend this set and would definitely purchase again.\", 'Title: Awesome Cupsand spoons set!; Content: I am so happy my measuring cups finally arrived! These measures are above and beyond what I expected.... I love the color code on each and everyone of them I was going to give these as a Christmas present quick change of heart after I opened them right away not today they have plans for A rhubarb custard ,,,,, There is not one issue about these measuring cups and spoons they are absolutely fabulous!', \"Title: These are the best set of measuring utensils I have ever bought!; Content: Do not ever buy plastic measuring cups the handles break off after so long. I decided to treat myself to a top quality set of .ensuring utensils and I'm in love with the spoons! These long and sleek measuring spoons fit down in everything you need to measure! Why are we not making measuring spoons like this year's ago? I only wish the measuring cups were long and sleek like the spoons cuz sometime the cups don't fit well. I love the stainless steel. I just give a wipe out with a towel when I measure dry ingredients. Well worth the money! This set will probably outlive me!\", 'Title: Favorite; Content: I love the fact that everything is measured perfectly!! My old measuring cups made me calculate to get the right amounts. With these I just need to find the measurement I’m looking for and I’m done. Great quality, sturdy, and easy to clean.', 'Title: Great design for usability and lasting use; Content: Measures on the cups etched/stamped into the metal so they won’t fade or get scraped off and leave you guessing. Handle covers prevent them getting hot when measuring hot foods (like for serving portions) Measuring spoons, even the tablespoon, will fit into a spice bottle due to their shape. Makes it a lot easier than trying to pour the spice into the spoon.', 'Title: Great for any kitchen; Content: Loved all the different measures. Reduced need to measure twice or guess at half size. Love the long measuring spoon bowls.

US and matric measurements stamped deep into the handles that won't wear off. Very sturdy and nice color coded design. These stainless steel cups will last a lifetime. I like the extra cups that aren't in the normal 4 or 5 cup sets. These would also make a great gift and come in a nice box.\", \"Title: Very happy with purchase; Content: I have not as of yet had issues with the rubber parts popping out.

There is a small gap between the handle and the cup where things can get stuck. Very happy thus far with my purchase.\", 'Title: Cute and colorful, but not drawer friendly; Content: they are cute and colorful, but the colored silicone is not flush with the handles, so they do not nest and compact - they take up a lot of space in drawer of cabinet - the ring is not very pliable to open and has rusted up already. also the silicone pops out of the handle, makes for a breeding ground for bacteria. - would not recommend - wish I had returned in time frame', 'Title: Perfect Update For Old Measuring Cups and Spoons.; Content: I love this set.

Super happy with my purchase!!!', \"Title: The rubber colorful handles are cool but they wiggle; Content: I love this set it's got every measurement I need! However the colors that are on each handle are just rubber pieces that I can feel moving when I'm washing them/using them, hoping washing them won't get them moldy. Other than that I love them and I'd love it if they came in different finishes (copper, gold, etc.) And maybe sturdier handles.\", 'Title: Sturdy; Content: These are exactly what I have been looking for. A good complete set that the number cannot was off of.

I have been using it for last three months almost everyday, not everything but measuring cups and spoons and some stainless steel bowls. They have held up well.', 'Title: A FANTASTIC SET!; Content: These are really really nice. Just like the heavy-duty old-fashioned stainless steel bowls my mom used to have, only better! These have color-coded rubbery bottoms and color lids to match, plus measuring cups & spoons AND an assortment of brightly-colored spatulas & spoons & other utensils! Really, really nice set with a lot of bowls is various sizes, and well worth the price! I absolutely love this set.', \"Title: Really good quality; Content: I've been using these for well over a month and have no complaints at all as far as quality. However the upward curve at the end of the forks causes them to slide inwards on my plates. So I often find the handle in my pancake syrup or spaghetti sauce. I'm now learning to flip the forks over to avoid that.\", 'Title: Really nice; Content: I love these. No frill but really sturdy and perfect size. Quality is nice! Great every day use. You can even dip ice cream without bending.', 'Title: Elegant solid silverware set; Content: This flatwear set is beautiful ❤️. Sturdy, shiney, stunning, thick, and looks way more expensive than it was. Good deal!', 'Title: Junk!; Content: This is my first negative Amazon review, but I’m very frustrated. The item cracked after a couple months of use, the company doesn’t stand by their products, and because it was past the return date, Amazon can’t help me with the issue. I asked if I could just get the cup that broke replaced, “Nope!”. I asked if I could send back the set for a new one, “Nope!” This took way too much time and energy, and they are probably banking on the fact that it’s too time consuming to do anything about it. It sucks too, because I really liked this set.', 'Title: Handle broke after 3 months use; Content: Product works as advertised however we have already had the handle come off the 1 cup measuring cup. Not sure how well the others will hold up.', 'Title: Doesn’t seem to hold up to regular use; Content: I thought these measuring cups looked great and I was pleased with them until today. I took the 1 cup measure out of the drawer and it was cracked on two sides. I haven’t abused these utensils and an mystified as to why these cracks appeared running from the rim towards the bottom.', \"Title: Garbage; Content: ½ cup broke between the handle and the cup with nearly no pressure. after looking at it, the weld did not penetrate the metal and only deformed the metal casing a friction fit. I wanted metal so they'd hold up better, I guess I'll just have to go plastic so it's one piece.\", 'Title: Not a good bang for the buck.; Content: This set, although \"stainless steel\", is very flimsy. The handles bend very easily. I would not recommend these to anyone wanting to measure anything other than flower and sugar. Pretty disappointed since they were over $20. They\\'re about the same quality as the $5 ones I bought.', 'Title: Non magnetic; Content: These look good and and are advertised as stainless steel (magnetic). They do not stick to a magnet and cannot be mounted. I contacted the manufacturer and never heard back.', \"Title: Handle can break off; Content: My wife said the handle on the cup sized measure broke off. Seems like the welding didn't stick. I haven't been able to solder it back together.\", 'Title: Mis-printed size & no 2/3 cup; Content: I liked the design of them but they sent two different sizes both stamped 1/3 cup (one of them is actually 1/4). I also didnt realize there is no 2/3 cup when I ordered them & I use that size a lot.', 'Title: Cup good. Spoons not so much.; Content: The cups are awesome. Even has the 1/8 cup. The spoons are nice, the stack nicely, but the size marking has washed off a couple of the and I have only had them for about a month.', 'Title: Spoons Great, Cups Bad; Content: The measuring spoons are great, but the cups bend easily.', 'Title: Good product for price; Content: These are decent measuring cups and spoons for the price. I was not expecting a culinary top of the line product for what I paid. I was expecting them to be labeled correctly. My 1/2 cup was labeled 1/4 cup. (see photo) For me no big deal and most would know the difference but if you are buying these for a child it may be an issue. Hopefully the company has corrected this or at least been made aware of the problem.', \"Title: Could be sturdier; Content: These are perfectly fine, overall, but the handle is heavier than the cup for all but the 1/2 and full cup, so they don't lay flat on the counter when you set them down empty and they feel flimsier than I was expecting. Another review mentioned the handles being bent and I could easily see that happening. The rubber pieces on the measuring cups are set in very big holes in the handle and can come out easily, while the hole in the rubber on which it would hang is small enough that you have to be fairly intentional putting it on the ring. I bought magnets so they are stored on the side of my fridge and I appreciate that they stay securely on there. They are fine, overall. I won't be telling everyone I know how fantastic they are, but they're good enough to keep, not return.\", 'Title: Convenient set overall.; Content: Spoon set magnets are a little weaker than another set I purchased from a different Amazon vender. But still decent.', \"Title: Great product just wish spoons had text engraved as well.; Content: Overall great product and well built. One of the reasons I chose this product was because I wanted the markings engraved in the metal so they don't wear off over time. Although the measuring cups have this feature, the measuring spoons do not and the text has already started to wear off after just a few months of use.\", \"Title: Great design but lacks in quality; Content: They are awesome at what they do and the magnetic spoons are the real reason I got this set. The handles on the measuring cups are not strong enough though. They will bend when put to normal stress, scooping flour or brown sugar. It's not enough that I wouldn't buy them again, but its enough to mention.\", 'Title: FYI Mismarked Measuring Cup; Content: Set I received had the 1/8 cup marked as 2/3 cup. As you can see there is a big difference. The erroronously marked one must be the diet version!!!! LOL', 'Title: Good set, but...; Content: I really got these for the spoons. The only prob with the cups is they all have the same handle so the 1/4 AND 1/8 cup tip due to the weight of the handle.', \"Title: I love this set!; Content: These are now my favorite measuring spoons! The magnets ensure that the spoons stay together and don't go skidding all over the drawer. I love that these have the narrow scoops for easy access into bottles and tins.\", 'Title: Easy to store & find in the drawer.; Content: Well made and easy to use. Love that the cups stack inside each other for storage and the spoons stick together magnetically. In the past, I had to always search in my \"misc\" drawer for the exact measuring spoon I wanted, but these are always front & center, easy to separate and use individually. Love them!', 'Title: Easy to Read, Easy to Use!!!; Content: These measuring spoons and cups are the best! The spoons are easy to read and I love that there are two of each size, no more stopping to wash out the spoon after putting in the honey! They are magnetized and always easy to find in my kitchen drawer. I bought the cups just as an add on and I am so glad I did! The cups are on a sturdy ring so the stay together until you take them apart, rare indeed. I no longer have to search my kitchen drawer for that pesky 1/4 cup measure, it’s right there on the ring. Love these!!!', 'Title: Nice Set; Content: They were just what I was looking for The magnetic feature helps keep order in the kitchen drawers and the lips of the spoons and cups are are even and easy to clean Nice set for cooking and baking', 'Title: Great set; Content: I wanted to start measuring out my food. I needed a set that included the cup measurements and spoons. This set is sturdy and I love the magnetic stacking function of the spoons. Helps this set store easier', 'Title: Great addition to my kitchen; Content: Beautiful stainless steel easy to read markings. Having two sides to the spoons make baking efficient for wet and dry ingredients. Magnetic feature makes them easy to store. Light weight but sturdy in your hand or just flat on the counter to have all your ingredients measured out before food preparation.', 'Title: Magnetic spoons are great; Content: This set is really sturdy, has all the measuring sizes I need, and the magnetic feature keeps the spoons from getting lost in the drawer.', \"Title: LOVE my new measuring set!!!; Content: I love that it's sturdy & that the measuring cups come on a ring to keep them together for storage. The magnetic measuring spoons are great because you don't have to fumble with a ring when you need to use only one to measure & you wash only what you use!\", 'Title: Love the magnet feature!; Content: I love how the spoons magnet together! The double sided also allows for me to use it multiple times I can have a wet and dry side, and I can get into small bottles! Love these', 'Title: durable; Content: i bought these for home brewing and wine making. they are very durable and easy to clean. the dog have gotten them many time, and survived.', 'Title: Better than expected; Content: The brushed metal is beautiful. They remind me of my mom’s measuring cups from the ‘60s.', 'Title: Good design and quality; Content: They’ so cute and all stainless steel zGood quality ! Spoons with magnetic,Measuring cups with key chain,it’s easy to use and store.', \"Title: Heavy and durable. Love them!; Content: Absolutely love that they have spoonsnon both sides somI don't have to stop and wash the spoon if I need it again. The magnets are strong and keep them together quite well. They are solid and way better than any other I have had.\", 'Title: Very odd size; Content: These are too tall and skinny to wash easily in the dishwasher, and not very practical for storage. Not a fan at all', 'Title: Great Purchase; Content: Love that they are measuring bowls', 'Title: Not real stainless steel; Content: These are not real stainless steel. In less than a year, the coating is beginning to wear off and they are no longer safe for food.', 'Title: Metal taste; Content: Couldnt get the metal taste out of straws after mutiple uses and washes. Didnt like feeling on teeth.', \"Title: STRAWS THAT ARE REUSABLE AND BETTER FOR THE PLANET; Content: I've been using stainless steel straws for a few years now and I love them. Easy to clean with the small cleaning brush that you get separately or sometimes with them at time of purchase. I bought these as extras for Christmas gift extras for my niece and friends who are environmentally concerned and are trying to get away from disposable plastic straws.\", 'Title: Love my forever straws; Content: These straws are great! Yes they take on the hot or cold tempuratures of what they are used for, so take care. But if rinsed and brushed right away they are forever straws, and can be boiled to disinfect. Have them in my puese, backpack, car, and suitcase.', 'Title: BEAUTIFUL STRAWS; Content: They are beautifully made! I bought 6 of the 12 pack multicolored metal straws and all of them are functional and freaking beautiful! I wish there was an option to buy only the rainbow colored ones or only the gold ones because I would definitely buy more', 'Title: Very Pretty.; Content: These Straws are very pretty. I have been using Stainless Steel straws for a few year, but this is the first time I’ve bought any that weren’t just plain silver. I like that I can match the, to my cups. The finish does not look like it will wear off easily.', 'Title: Fits big 24oz cups; Content: The different colors were vibrant! Put in dishwasher on top shelf. They fit on my rungs. It was perfect for cleaning & came out sparkling!', 'Title: Stainless vs. Plastuc; Content: I am Very happy with the stainless steel straws; especially knowing this helps a little bit toward helping the eco system.', 'Title: Love em!!!; Content: Loveeee these straws! I’ve tried a few re-usable straws and these are by far my favorite. The colors are beautiful (sweet as little gifts) and the quality is great. Love the thinner circumference as well.', 'Title: Best idea!; Content: I love drinking with the metal straws. Everything tastes so much colder', 'Title: I would not purchase these again.; Content: Lids don’t fit. Not double walled stainless steel. I did not get whisk or measuring spoons. The grater and slicer didn’t work because they were so cheap.', 'Title: Such a useful set...; Content: These bowls are beautiful stainless, sturdy and uniquely useful for slicing and shredding veggies directly into the bowl with no awkward, difficulty holding the sharp plates in place. This was a great purchase and I wish I had had these years ago. I think they would make a one of a kind, great wedding shower gift.', 'Title: Overall a gem; Content: I love the measuring lines on tbe inside.The handles The large slicer is a joke', \"Title: Better than I ever imagined.; Content: These are amazing. I use them so much. They are pretty to look at when you're cooking. I would buy them as a gift too.\", \"Title: Just get them.; Content: They're great and easy to use and clean. The rubber bottoms are quiet and easy on the counter when my frantic whisking gets out of control. And with the graters, I can ditch my mandolin that takes up a lot of space.\", \"Title: My Fault; Content: I ended up returning these because I did't get the correct measurements of what I needed. However they did seem very durable.\", 'Title: Rusting cheap material; Content: Only had the set for couple of mouths and they are rusting', 'Title: Check the sizes!; Content: These were a gift for my daughter in law, from her Amazon wish list. They were a lot smaller than either of us expected. But they seem sturdy.', 'Title: Size for every need and easy to clean; Content: Love the fact that I get 3 sizes of each. I learned a long time ago a little oil spray on the wire racks makes cleanup a breeze. They wash up great and look like new as long as you wash them after you use them. Love this set x3!', 'Title: Totally awesome set; Content: I love this set 5 of them fit side by side in my cabinet perfectly. Great capacity they really hold a lot. Really cleaned up my cabinet I love it. Easy to clean although I only washed them once which was right before use. This is the perfect set for me.']\n",

I put some food away in the fridge to marinate and when I took it out a saw a tiny crack on the rim of the bowl. I ignored it, it was tiny. then today im washing it and notice 2 more cracks on the other side of the bowl that arent tiny at ALL, theyre actually starting to ride down the side of the bowl. its one thing if these bowls were banged around and all but I barely cook so i hardly use them. this might have been my 3rd time using them and I usually use the biggest bowl to marinate my foods. my biggest and smallest bowls take most of the beatings. this may have been why first time using the 5qt bowl in the fridge and it cracked. side note, I never put these in the dishwasher, as im afraid the rubber would separate from the bottom. these are hand washed, well taken care of bowls.', \"Title: Harder to break than Pyrex; Content: I had a 4 qt Pyrex bowl that lasted for about 2 weeks. It was in the sink and it barely tapped the side and a giant sliver split off making the lip of the bowl dangerously sharp. This product doesn't suffer from that malady. I've mainly only used to the large bowl for mixing and meal prep. The lid fits snug (useful for bread and dough making). The rubberized bottom keeps the bowl from sliding around the counter when kneading in the bowl.

The slicing/shredding inserts are so incredibly dull that they’re basically worthless. You could literally give them to a toddler to play with and have absolutely no worries about injury. After trying to shred carrots and slice cucumbers with these, and having no luck whatsoever, I finally tossed them in the trash can. I thought, “Well, at least the bowls are nice.” Less than a week later, I dropped one of the bowls on the floor and the handle just popped off. They’re not screwed on, just sort of glued, so into the trash went the handle. Finally, while the lids on the smaller two bowls fit well, the lid for the larger one refuses to go on and stay on.

The lids hold surprisingly well. I took the largest bowl (5 quarts), filled it with 3.5 quarts of water, put the lid and held the bowl upside down. The lid held! I shook the bowl a little and the lid still held! On the 5 quart bowl the lid was water tight. On the smallest bowl there was a little leak but the lid didn't fall off. I would not expect the lids to stay put if you DROPPED a full bowl but I didn't test that. If you fill the a bowl with hot food and then put the lid on the steam will eventually loosen the lid and pop it off a little. You push the lid back on ... after a while the lid gets loose again. Put the lid on again and by now the food has cooled enough so that the lid stays put. Not a problem. Very easy to clean. Some of the lids became a little warped after I rinsed them with hot water.

That is annoying because they then aren't presentable.\", 'Title: The lids are very flimsy not dishwasher safe.; Content: Don’t waste you money the Lids are too flimsy not dishwasher safe', 'Title: Very attractive but cant recommend; Content: This review is lengthy and I apologize. PROs: The containers are very attractive and fit well in the hand at 3 ½ inches wide. The tallest of the containers is only useful (my experience) for pasta or other products with low weight as a heavier item (rice for instance) makes the container top heavy when filled. The lid is easy to lock into place and it does seal items in the container. CONs: There are many different manufacturers on Amazon offering containers like this product as this container style is very popular. However, not all products are dishwasher safe. The manufacturer of this product indicates it is dishwasher safe but does not recommend placing the lids in the dishwasher. The product vendor recommends not placing the lids in water to clean. Instead they recommend wiping the lids with a cloth. The reason for this is that the lid is made of two halves connected by a metal spring inside. The two halves separates slightly when the lid is in the unlocked position. The advertising states they are air tight, which they are when closed. However, liquids or materials that are fine such as flour can enter the lid from the top where the locking mechanism is at. Or, at the separation of the two halves when unlocked. If food particles get inside the lid it is (my experience) near impossible to clean out and it requires a blow dryer to dry out thoroughly if water/liquids gets inside. You can see from pictures that the lids seem to close unevenly and that food such as flour, sugar, bread crumbs, etc cling to the sides of the containers and the lids increasing the chance that food particles will get inside the lid which I believe could cause mold if not cleaned well. I have containers from two different manufacturer and I like the look and feel but I will not repurchase any container with this lid type. There are similar containers that have different lid types. I recommend getting a container with solid lids that use a screw connection, press on fit or use some sort of clamp with silicone/rubber seals that can be easily cleaned. Make sure you can wash in a dishwasher. Unfortunately, getting containers with a better lid appears to increase the price by $5 to $10+.', 'Title: Not stainless steel.

Great for prepping and seasoning meats and vegetables, or beating eggs for breakfast.

So just keep in mind that the graters are for more heavy duty cooking. Incredibly easy to clean. Love that the bottom has rubber to keep the bowls from sliding around.

That one won't do as well in that regard since the smaller removable part for the graters doesn't sit as tight and doesn't secure it from any airflow as well as the outer edge alone would. The graters work OK, not sure I'd ever really use them here since it's just a bit awkward, and the rest of the tools that were bundled with it are pretty junk quality, I assume added simply so they could add to the number of pieces in the description without impacting the price much.

These fit the bill. These are solidly made. The lids clip on all four sides creating an airtight seal. You can stack them to better utilize space.

It has a smart range of sizes and the largest size, which feels huge, still fits neatly in my cabinet. They have measurements etched onto the interior, and the silicone bottoms prevent the bowls from sliding around on the counter without adding any excess weight. The rims are rolled so pouring is easy and mess-free, but they still stick out just enough to get a comfortable grip. Contrary to some reviews, the lids DO fit perfectly, you just have to glance at the directions. You place the lid on the bowl, then press down firmly in the middle to lock the lid in place by pressing some air out. The suction from the vacuum is what keeps the seal tight. If that sounds unstable, it's not. I've used these to marinate food in and you can turn them completely upside down and that lid isn't going anywhere. I don't understand the complaints about the inside of the bowls getting scratched, I mean, they're mixing bowls not art pieces?

The Pros: Price. It comes with a lot of accessories, such as measuring tools and a whisk. The bowls are sturdy. Air tight lid when in room temperature. The Cons: The accessories are cheap plastic and whisk is flimsy. The bowl is study because of the crease at the bottom and top side of the bowl. I would of like for it to be smooth all around. The lid are not tight when placed in a cold place like a refrigerator. The plastic lid is pliable plastic and contract when cold, so it would contract about1/4 of an inch so it render the lid loose.

I have been wanting them for a while and looked around for them at a lot of places and finally decided to buy them of Amazon because of the price. They are nice and big and store nicely (nesting bowls) in the pantry/kitchen cabinets. But they are not stainless. You really have to clean them nicely for them to not leave any mark/stain. Also I am not sure about the lids. They seem flimsy but I still have to use them enough to comment on the same.\", \"Title: They'll do!; Content: This product is good. The stainless steel actually does stain a bit, but it doesn't make them unusable. The lids don't fit properly, so I have to cover with parchment or waxed paper before the lid.

Why? Bowls like these should last a long time.\", \"Title: Great Bowls, Not So Great Lids; Content: The mixing bowls are great. Nice sizes and easy to clean. However, the lids don't want to stay on. They don't have a secure fit so they pop out of place. I personally don't need to use the lids often, so this isn't really a problem for me. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this set if you need to use the lids.\", \"Title: These really are great; Content: When I do my baking, i'm always using odds and ends to mix and store things. When I bake i'm always looking for the right sizes and usually have to mix in one and then move it all to another bowl for either storage or other ingredients because either they can't handle hear or the hand mixer. These are really great. The sizes are perfect! The lids fit great, no more trying to get plastic wrap or tin foil to stick to the old mixed matched bowls i have. One feature that really is the best is the bottoms of these have thick silicone that not only keep the bowls weighed down but also keep them from moving around while you are using them. Using a hand mixer with one hand has now become easy. I do't have to worry about the bowl flying around the counter. The stainless steel is also very heavy duty thick too. The quality of them overall is really top notch. I didn't expect them to be so well made. They all fit into each other which saves space and that's another plus. They are deep meaning they are designed to be taller and less wide so things don't splash and spill as easy. I like that the lids are color matched to the bottom silicone colors of the bowls. This helps so you aren't trying to find which lid fits the right bowl, you just match colors. They can go in the fridge or freezer. They say they are dishwasher safe but I don't put silicone in the dishwasher so I won't try these bowls either, i don't want to take a chance. Super happy with this set and really don't have anything to complain about which is rare...lol\", \"Title: Finally, bowls that won't stain; Content: As much as I love my 20-years old plastic bowls, it was time for a change. I know that the most ideal mixing bowls are ceramic, but these stainless steel bowls are absolutely fantastic! It didn't matter to me if they have lids because how often do you need lids for mixing bowls? What I require of my bowls are that they won't get stained and that they are not flimsy. If the bowls are too light then they'll move around or even flip over while you're giving your mixing a good beating. Not only do they have some weight but there is the added bonus of that silicone bottom so it will stay in one place. Here's a really helpful part -- there are measurements on the inside of the bowls, too! These bowls are nice and weighty (but not too much!) and they hold the promise of no-staining from my many marinades with tomato or especially curry. This makes them easier to clean because I don't have to worry about scrubbing the yellow turmeric stains out of plastic and plus, plastic tends to fray (experienced cooks will understand this). There are no tiny pieces that will lift up in these bowls, that's for sure! Although the biggest bowl is pretty big, they fit inside one another for easy storage. Again, the lids just get in the way so I keep them underneath the bowls.\", \"Title: great mixing bowls - poor lids; Content: This is a great set of mixing bowls. I love stainless steel for cooking and food prep, and these are solid and well made. They are the first set I have used with a non-skid base, and it works pretty well - much better than bowls without the base. This is a particularly nice touch, as it can be extra taxing to mix something thick and heavy and have to fight a sliding bowl as well as stir the contents. While I was skeptical at first, I am now convinced that it is a must-have feature. The range of sizes is also very nice, and I am looking forward all kind of new food projects. The only down side is that the lids do not fit very well. They are the kind of lid that sits down inside the bowl rather than snapping over the top outside the rim, which I do not particularly care for. They also do not fit very tightly, and come off easily. However, I don't really care too much about lids, since foil or other kinds of wrap will work just fine. Still, if the lids are important to you, be aware that those are a weak point. It cost them a star. Other than the lids, I like these bowls very much.\", \"Title: Nice bowls, but could have better lids; Content: I like that these bowls come in a variety of sizes, nest so they don't take up too much space, and have lids. The bottoms have a silicon base that is nice for mixing but means you can't set a bowl over a pot of boiling water to melt chocolate or what have you, and stainless steel looks great but means you can't microwave them (again, if I'm microwaving a mixing bowl, it probably has chocolate). So they're great for mixing, but limited for some other uses I've come to assign to my existing mixing bowls. The lids are a very nice feature, but don't fit as snugly as I had hoped. I definitely would be concerned shaking a bowl to mix whatever is in it (like a dressing), even if I was holding the lid, and wouldn't just stick a bowl of something liquid in the back of my car and count on the lid to avoid a mess the way I might with some sealing containers. However, for what these are designed for (mixing and some light storage), they're still quite nice.\", 'Title: Fantastic nesting bowls with lids; Content: I already have a full set of nice stainless steel mixing bowls that I like. After running out of mixing bowls too often, I decided to get another set when the Vine program had some. I didn\\'t expect to like these as much, and now I love them. The metallic part of the bowl is sturdy, thicker than my classic bowls. The inside is shiny. The measuring notches on the side offer useful guidelines for volume. The lids are useful for storing leftover items like extra sauce, vegetables you didn\\'t use up and such. The silicone bottoms make these anti-slip, but that also means you can\\'t slide it across the counter. If you like to turn the bowls while mixing, use different bowls. These bottoms are designed to stay put. This is not a negative - it\\'s just different. These bowls are narrower than typical mixing bowls, so they\\'re taller. Some people may like that while others don\\'t. These nest nicely for storage without taking up too much space. The only improvement I\\'d make are on the lids. I wish they were dishwasher-safe. They also take some pushing and positioning to fit properly for maximum airtightness. I tested for leaks with the 3-quart bowl filled 2/3 with soup, put a lid on it, then flipped it. Amazingly (and thankfully), nothing leaked, and the lid didn\\'t fall off. While the lids work, I would NOT push its \"airtight\" claim. I\\'m just happy there are lids for easy storage. If you don\\'t want non-slippage feature for your mixing bowls, don\\'t get this set. If you want stability or need to mix using both hands, you\\'ll like these, like for pouring in an ingredient while mixing. Some sizes also make very nice salad bowls to eat out of. I love being able to use them for storage, too.', \"Title: AWESOME Mixing Bowls; Content: I LOVE these bowls. We previously had mismatched mixing bowls of glass and plastic that took up tons of space, but those are all out the window now that we have these! There are 6 different sized bowls in this set from 1 - 5 QT, so you've got tons of options depending on the sizing you need for mixing or storage. They all nest together perfectly which is super convenient as they hardly take up any space. The bowls themselves are really well made and look fantastic too. The stainless steel looks high quality and durable. They have a black, silicone bottom that helps keep them in place and makes them non marring on the bottom. The lids themselves are durable plastic that should last a long time, but they're hand wash only and there's a warning they may warp in the dishwasher, so make sure to hand wash the lids only. The bowls themselves though are dishwasher safe which is nice. With so many bowls and different sizes they're a really versatile set that should fulfill any mixing bowl/storage bowl need you may have. There are measurement markings inside the bowls as well which is really handy when dealing with specific proportions for baking or for liquids. The bowls looks so nice that we often put them out on the table filled with veggies, crackers, dips, etc. and always get compliments on how nice the bowls are. This is just a really great set that can eliminate a lot of bulky, mismatched bowls that are already in your kitchen collection. Highly recommend.\", \"Title: A fantastic set of stainless steel mixing bowls; Content: I really love this set of nesting stainless steel bowls. Stainless steel bowls are my favorite because, you never have to worry about breaking one, plus they're super easy to clean. The various sizes of these bowls is also great. The largest one is great for making a cake, and the smallest is perfect for whipping up a few eggs. I also love how the bottom of the bowls are coated with rubber, so they hold a bit better to the countertop. The only thing that I do not like about these bowls is the lids. The lids are just rubber inserts, but the problem is, they came slightly mishaped, so they don't fit into the bowls very well. Hopefully over time they will go back to a round shape, and this problem will go away.... Overall they are great bowls, and I use them daily in my kitchen.\"]\n",

They do scratch at least the shiny inside of bowls if you don’t use anything but silicone utensils. Don’t mind the scratches as they still function. As far as the LIDS they are OK. Literally that. As soon as I got the bowls some lids were kind deformed and didn’t fit as nice as I though. They claim the product is dishwasher safe and my lids got even more deformed. Might be my fault as I had the wash cycle on hot and steam sanitize. So take with a grain of salt. Graters are okay as well. I think when your buying this product your really paying for the bowls. Not lids and graters. Regardless if I’d have to buy another set I’d buy them again. $35 for some nice bowls isn’t bad at all. 4 stars (4.5 if I could) cause lids and graters are OK.', 'Title: Extremely pleased; Content: From reading the reviews I was a little unsure but went ahead and bought the set. I am extremely pleased with the look of the products the seal of the product. The lids are not overly flimsy (as one review stated) they’re just enough to make it an airtight seal, so it’s perfect. The grater attachments go on the lid of the big bowl. I was unsure if it came with a plug so it can be sealed also, I’m awesomely happy to say it does. I can take it to a party, family get together or somewhere else and not have to worry about it leaking. I have not used it yet but look forward to doing so. The only concern I have is using a handmixer and what it will do to the stainless steel.', \"Title: Nice quality bowls and lids; Content: Purchased these to be primary mixers and left over storage.

Dishwasher safe.... once nice feature I didn't see when I purchased was the larger lid comes with an insert in which you can put slicer, grater and other attachments on. That was a nice surprise. I think for the price these are great and will last a long time.

These are very well made in my opinion. Very nicely polished and shiny, no scratches or dents when arrived. The matching colors non-skid silicone bottoms and lids are also a very nice touch. Although one or two of the lids are a little warped, it wasn't that big a deal. Just followed the description on the product page to push down the middle of the lid to air out creating a vacuum inside and then press with both hands on the edges repeatedly to create a super tight lid for the bowls. Not quite sure if the lids are made of hardened silicone or plastic but just to be safe do not microwave the lids or dish wash them, only hand wash to prevent warping or deform. Similarly, with the three graters included, hand washes only. The silicone spatula set and measuring spoons are bonuses to me considering the six beautifully made durable stainless steel bowls with lids are well worth the price by themselves. Needless to say, I am very impressed with this whole set, very well made and so useful for me.\", 'Title: Love the bowls, lids not so much; Content: I was in the market and for some prepping bowls as I cook a lot and these seemed like a great deal. The bowls themselves are sturdy and I have no issues with them. The lids, however, suck. They are not airtight and if you use them in the fridge, they contract more. Some of them (mainly the largest lid) are not even level and there is no way to flatten it out so it is unusable. The additional tools that came with them are also surprisingly good quality. I didnt need more but I make good use of the measuring spoons and cups and even the brush.', 'Title: Great bowls, but don’t count on the lids; Content: Great assortment of sizes for prep work, but calling the lids “airtight” is a huge stretch. Sitting still they cover fine but any jarring will knock it loose. I was initially disappointed in the size assortment since I was hoping for a couple of bowls on the larger end....you should notice the sizes between the largest and second-largest have quite a gap. However, after getting them, I’ve found the sizes to be absolutely perfect for meal prep. I didn’t know I was needing some of these, to be honest. Super easy to clean, measuring cup/spoon set is nice enough. Other tools in the set are rather small but ok.', 'Title: Great stainless steal with real leak proof lids; Content: I use and love these stainless steel mixing bowls constantly. The lids fit really well and are honestly leak proof. There are measurements printed on the inside, which I love.

No hesitation in recommending these mixing bowls.', \"Title: Great beautiful bowls; Content: I love the look of these bowls! Nice quality bowels, the silicone on the bottom to keep it from sliding around is nice especially when my 6 year old is helping me. The reason I have 4 starts was because I am a little frustrated. I bought these bowls because of the lids that come with. The 3 biggest bowls lids work great the second to smallest is REALLY difficult to push in and the smallest will not stay in at all as soon as I let go it pops right back out! I did not wash these in super hot water or in the dishwasher so I know it wasn't something that I did to them... Seeing as the 2 smallest are the ones I needed lids for the most I am disappointed but they are still great as mixing bowls and will get a ton of use in my house and are a beautiful addition to my growing collection of stainless steel and silicone cooking utensils.\", \"Title: Great bowls lids are pretty useless!; Content: What a great set of bowls for the price!! Super impressive! Way better then I expected for the price! My 14 year old daughter has taken an interest in baking and we needed some mixing bowls.

DISAPPOINTING EDIT: Unfortunately, I have to edit my review because the lids not only warp in the dishwasher but they never sealed right to begin with and are now basically useless.. such a BUMMER! Because I really like the bowls!\", \"Title: Bowls are great. Lids aren't. They randomly pop off.; Content: I don't know what the deal is here - when this went through Vine in Feb they were pastel colored bowls with matching lids, and no graters and no holes in lids for them. I think my review is still pertinent, though, because they're using the same type lids, and that's my main focus. The lids don't work reliably. There's no latch or lip or catch, they're just push-in. Plastic on stainless isn't going to hold, and these don't. Sometimes as quickly as 2 mins, the lid will pop out, sometimes it slowly (relatively) slides out. We already had a really good set of bowls exactly like this, just without lids. Bowls like this are a dime a dozen these days. The ones we had were over 5 yrs old and same design, so it was the lids I was most interested in. Sadly, this makes them a 2 star for me. The steel is decently done, smooth and even and strong. The silicone on the bottoms are very effective non-skid. Just the lids aren't reliable.

First, quality. The bowls are decent, not high quality just decent. The lids are horribly cheap, I would not store food as they are not air tight seals. Second, cleaning. The bowls are dishwasher safe, however the lids are not. Don’t even try to put them in the top rack thinking that maybe they well be ok, they won’t. I tried it out of curiosity and they warp badly and won’t fit back on the bowl. Third, storage. The bowls are nested but not with the lids on them individually. Those just stack on top. The largest bowl measures at the widest point across the rim is 10” and 5.5” tall, so they will fit in the upper shallow kitchen cabinets. Add another 1-2 inches for the lids on top. Fourth, features. Silicone bottoms are good especially when the grand kids help in the kitchen. Bowls stay in place. The measuring lines on the inside of the bowls are in quarts and liters. Not heavily marked but visible closer up. I tested one bowl at the .5 and 1 quart lines, reasonably accurate, but still prefer to measure with other utensils. Last, price and usage. There was no price on these at the time I reviewed them but I have looking for a set of bowls for some time. My guess is under $40. The lids are just not practical to use for me. The bowls are decent and I can see us using them for when all the kids and grandkids are in the kitchen helping, so the quantity is good. I will likely set some of these aside solely for their craft projects and concoction. On a personal note, for everyday use, I would prefer a set of higher quality bowls and lids that are airtight.', 'Title: Good quality and sturdy bowls. Non-slip base works well. Cheap lids.; Content: These are good sturdy bowls that feel like they will last for many years of use. Definitely more solid than the cheap supermarket bowl I had before. I really like the non-slip bases, especially on the smaller bowls which I would be more likely to accidentally knock over. The way the bowls nest together is great. I definitely wouldn\\'t have space in my kitchen to store them otherwise. The bowls also have a useful scale marked on the inside, and it\\'s etched into the steel, not painted or printed, so it won\\'t wear off. I found two negatives. One is the lids. As other reviewers have pointed out, they feel cheap, aren\\'t airtight and are not dishwasher safe. The design is poor, the lids are solid plastic with just a thin rib around the rim that\\'s meant to seal against the inside edge of the bowl. Plastic is too stiff for this. A rubber seal would be needed to make it airtight. The second is the FDA logo on the packaging. I won\\'t speculate as to why the manufacturer chose to put the logo there, but the use of the logo does not signify that the product is FDA certified in any way. In fact, this is misuse of the FDA logo. According to the FDA website: \"FDA’s logo is for official government use only. FDA’s logo should not be used to misrepresent the agency or to suggest that FDA endorses any private organization, product, or service.\" There\\'s nothing about dishwasher safety on the bowls or the packaging or in the product description, but never having had a problem with stainless steel, and seeing other reviewers report success, I took a chance. The bowls came out of the dishwasher just fine. However, having seen another reviewer mention the lids warped even on the top rack, so I didn\\'t try those. I did notice that when I dried the outside rim of the bowls, which collect some water when the bowls are upturned in the dishwasher, it left black stains on my kitchen towel. I wouldn\\'t expect a dishwasher to be able to clean under the rims, so it\\'s my fault for not washing them by hand the first time, but it would be nice if the manufacturer cleaned the rims before packaging.', \"Title: These storage bowls are as great as they are saying; Content: I already love these stainless steel bowls. They are much lighter than some of the Pyrex glass bowls I would use to store cut up foods I would make for dinner prep. I have been able to put some older, colorful Tupperware storage bowls in a donation bin as the plastic isn't as practical to use as stainless steel. The mixed colored tops and bottoms are fun and do their job of keeping the bowl steady and I haven't had a problem with the lids securing tightly. They are of course, Made in China, which seems to be something we can't always get away from. Price is great for what you get and they should last borderline forever. Have not used them for mixing wet/dry ingredients yet, but I can see they will be my go to bowls for that. Love them!\", \"Title: Nice set; Content: These bowls are made of reasonably heavy and sturdy stainless steel. The non-skid bottoms are great for working on slick stone countertops. They have measuring marks inside, which in theory seems very useful but in practice really isn't. In my experience, all measuring bowls stack for storage so I'm not really impressed with that. The smaller ones especially are getting a lot of use. The lids fit okay but are not airtight. I never had mixing bowls with lids before and they certainly are handy for storing something in the refrigerator for few hours, keeping flies out of food at a picnic, etc.\", 'Title: The bowls are great, the lids not so much.; Content: We wanted this set for the rubber base - non slip and really stable. The bowls are decently heavy duty and easy to clean. The lids were a nice addition, but had nothing to do with us getting these. Good thing. Out of all the bowls, only two of the lids actually fit well and stay on. The rest are either too warped, too small, or are not deep enough to stay closed. The smallest one was all three of those. The lids have more of a plastic feel than rubber. The bases of the bowls are rubbery and really grippy, plus they have ridges. The fact that they nest is great, and they are dishwasher safe. A nice bonus is the scale makes inside all but the smallest bowl. Markings are in liters and quarts. Adding cups would have been a nice addition, but converting is not that difficult. Bowls - 5 stars. Lids - 3 stars.', \"Title: Lightweight stainless steel bowls w/fitted lids, measuring marks, & non-slip bottoms.; Content: These Wildone stainless steel nesting bowls have fitted lids to go with each of them, & measuring marks on the interior in quart and liter volumes. The bowls are shiny on the inside and have a brushed finish on the outside. The bottoms have a black silicone coating to ensure that they stay put on the counter/surface while mixing, or just resting. The weight of the bowls are light - much lighter than my Cuisinart stainless steel bowls that I've had for the last 12+ years. I like that the bowls have lids that are fitted. If you hold up the lip on the lid, the air will come out like you are burping it. I would not consider the lids to be airtight as professed since I find it difficult to get them to stay fitted & seated down into the bowl as is intended. The smallest lid arrived deformed (bent up). I wish the bowls had a place for you to grip them with your thumb/fingers like my Cuisinart old stainless steel bowls do. The price is steep for this set at $60+ right now, and I would not pay that much for this set. The durability of these bowls will be realized in the test of time.\", 'Title: Sturdy with a Non-Slip Bottom; Content: Out of the box, the significant other liked these bowls. The bowls seemed sturdy and well-made, and we immediately noticed the level markings in side the bowls, which we consider a huge plus. The significant other was initially chagrined that the largest bowl is 5 quarts, because she makes a few dishes requiring very large bowls. However, she has very large bowls, so these help fill in sizes she currently does not have. The point is that if larger bowls are needed, buy larger bowls. Of course, one of the first things we tried were the lids. Unfortunately, the lids do not stay as secure as we would like. The lids tend to pop up just a little bit in one or more places around the periphery of the bowl. We tried pushing the lids down with as much force as possible, but they kept popping up, though not completely. So, the lids will seal the bowls, they will just not stay all the way down. Each bowl has a silicone bottom to decrease sliding. We love the silicone because our countertops are granite, and stainless steel has a tendency to slide, particularly when the bowls are empty. The silicone appears to be well-attached, so it should last for many years. We both love the level markings inside the bowls. It can be challenging to measure quantities in bowls this large, and the level markings we consider to be a huge advantage. Of course the bowls nest or sit inside each other for storage, and the lids similarly stack to minimize cabinet space. Our rating for value is average to above average given the quality of the finish and the markings. We considered whether the inability of the lids to stay seated should reduce our rating of value and decided that the overall quality was high for the price. Our rating for these bowls is five stars even though the lid fit could be improved. The brushed external finish, the polished internal finish, the apparent thickness of the bowls, the silicone bottom, and the markings inside the bowls are all advantages to these bowls that keep our rating high even with the lid fit. Enjoy!', \"Title: Great Addition to any Kitchen!; Content: Wife's Review: I love this set! By coming as a set of six different sizes, they pretty much cover every size I would ever need. The measuring marks on the inside of every bowl, and the non-skid bottoms make them great for beginner bakers and having the lids so that I can store things right in the mixing bowls is wonderful! So far, the lids have fit snug, which makes me wonder about their ability to hold up in the dishwasher, since other reviews have mentioned an issue with their fit, and mine have not been washed in the dishwasher because it's broken.\", 'Title: Wildone Set of 5 Stainless Steel Bowls With Lids; Content: These bowls are amazing! 6 Stainless steel bowls that are perfect for my life style.

The bowls are solid heavy grade Stainless steel, and the silicon for no slide around while cooking. Bowls are dishwasher safe but lids must be hand washed, and freezer safe. Smart investment', 'Title: Nice set of bowls; Content: This is a set of 6 stainless steel bowls in graduated sizes with lids. The bowls are marked on the inside with fluid volumes in quarts and liters. On the outsides, they have silicone coatings around the bases to make them non-slip. The lids are made with BPA-free plastic and slide into the tops. The steel bowls are dishwasher safe, while the manufacturer recommends hand washing the lids. The product was made in China. I have found these bowls very useful in my kitchen. As steel bowls go, these are relatively tall with straight-ish sides. For example, the largest bowl (5 quarts) is 9.5” wide and 5.5” tall. I have another bowl set that tends to run wide and shallow. With the other bowl set, I had to be careful about using my hand mixer because liquids would fly out the sides. But these Wildone bowls are nicely shaped for a mixer—whipped cream, for instance, stays put while you’re mixing. Whisking is likewise a cinch in these bowls. The lids of these bowls are a nice feature. They would snap on, but because they are air tight, they trap air so you have to force them down and they don’t audibly snap shut. The tightness of the seal depends on your room temperature since the metal and plastic are obviously different materials. Sometimes when I put a lid on, it initially fits snugly, then I watch it slide up of its accord due to air pressure. Basically, the lids do a great job of keeping odors in and spills out for storing food in the fridge. They also contain solid foods (like undressed salads) pretty well for traveling to potlucks. But they’re not entirely spill proof, so be careful if traveling with liquids in the bowls. Still, the lids work a lot better than plastic wrap. My other steel bowl set did not come with lids, so I use to have to cover food with plastic wrap and a lot of tape when I tried to travel with them. I’m so glad I don’t have to fight with plastic wrap or aluminum foil anymore. Overall, this is a very well-made set of bowls, with a good shape for cooking and handy lids.', \"Title: I love these...; Content: These are the best kitchen bowls that I've ever had in my arsenal. I use them for just about every meal I prepare and for every kitchen project. There are several things that make these standout... 1. The sizes they come in are useful. Other bowls are either too big or too small, these come in a variety that will fit whatever your needs are. 2. Storage capabilities. The lids are awesome. Yes, you will have to work to get them on but it is absolutely worth it. They fit snugly and keep what you are storing fresh. They are much better than aluminum foil and plastic wrap. 3. Storage capabilities, Take 2. These nest perfectly and take up minimal space in your cabinets. 4. The material they place at the bottom to hold it in place, ACTUALLY WORKS. You can easily whisk in oil and trust that the bowl isn't going to move all over the counter. It works very well. 5. Dishwasher safe. Legitimately dishwasher safe. They haven't warped or changed structure at all. The only thing that I can say that some people may have a hard time with is that they are thin. Not cheaply thin, just a bit on the thin side. A cook that is used to using either glass or plastic will have to adjust to these but in the end, it will be more than worthwhile. The price is excellent and you will find yourself using these over and over. A great find.\"]\n",

I am certain it happened somewhere in the post office.', 'Title: Not heavy duty; Content: These pans are not “heavy duty” as stated', 'Title: Heavy weight stainless steel baking pan; Content: A good price for 2 heavy weight stainless steel baking pans, no labels stick on it, shiny and pretty.

It\\'s very similar to other products offered online. The bowls are of good quality, and the non-slip base does a good job. The lids have inserts for grating discs, which is also a great concept and time saver. The downside is that the lids, as other users have mentioned, are on the \"plasticky\" side and will no doubt break down in time. I don\\'t expect them to last very long, but that\\'s the tradeoff for the great price I paid. I was going to buy the metal bowls without lids, so I figure these lids to be freebies that I will use as long as they last.', 'Title: Great product!; Content: I have always wanted a set of stainless steel mixing bows, and I managed to choose these really good ones!

I really like that the larger bowl has a place in the center to put 1of 3 graters (I didn’t have a grater either! 😮) Also, there are marks inside the bowls to show how much food/liquid is in it.

The largest bowl’s lid contains a cutout for the shredder and grater inserts, which is nice, although I’m not sure I’d always need the largest bowl. The nesting measuring cups and spoons are very nice and take up only as much space as the largest one. I like that they fit together for the purpose of being compact but aren’t tied together because I hate taking them apart or having to wash them all. Additionally the tools that come with this set are very nice silicone. The handles are a bit short but they’re functional and pretty.

These bowls have some fantastic features that totally set them apart from run of the mill bowls. First there's the rubber coating on the bottom, which keeps them from slipping on the counter. Then there's the measurement guide on the inside of each bowl, so you can see the quantity of your ingredients. Then there's the great fit of the lids. Then there's the ability to insert grating discs into the center of the largest bowl cover (I haven't actually tried this feature yet). I couldn't be happier with this wonderful find!\", \"Title: Bowl has a hole!; Content: My husband spent hours reading reviews and finally settled on these bowls to get me for Christmas. After using them for barely over a month we noticed that one of the bowls has a hole in the bottom! They scratch incredibly easily and are not sturdy at all. The lids also don't seal as advertised. Unfortunately we noticed the hole two days after the return window closed.\", \"Title: 🚨🚨🚨Update Still loving them👍👍👍; Content: I love them & using them everyday. I love (OATLY) oat milk but I don't trust what's in it so to be sure I make my own. This largest bowl allowed to nail down my recipe. I combine oat milk with cashew milk. Long story short, I love the esthetic of the bowls ( they still look brand new), the stability from the silicone base, the easy storage of nestled bowls I wish there was a way to buy the lids that have the holes for small dics for grating ect. I have changed my review 3 times and the quality of the bowls won out. I hope the manufacturing company reads reviews & helps me with my lids.\", 'Title: Nice Section of Bowls and Lids.; Content: I love all of the different sizes and lids.

Even so I love these bowls.', 'Title: Awesome bowls!; Content: The bowls are awesome! The set comes with 6 bowls and lids. I love that the bottom is made of rubber to prevent slippage. The bottoms are color coordinated with the tops. The larger bowl lid has an opening for the two graters. There is a coarse grater and a thinner one. Both pop into the lid with ease. When not using the grater, there is a plastic stopper that closes off the opening. It comes with measuring cups but they are so cheaply made that I likely won’t use them. It also comes with a set of mini utensils—frosting spatula, marinating brush, and a few others.

When I was there, I was introduced to these bowls. I was so impressed, that I immediately had him share the link, and I had them delivered by the time I got home. Well day one, out of the box, I was showing my wife how great the bowls were ---- BUT ---- I ended up finding that 2 of the lids (blue bowl and green bowl) do not fit snug at all on the bowls. It\\'s like the lids are too small... I like the bowls, but I will not be storing those two bowls in the refrigerator because I know it won\\'t keep the \"freshness\" of the contents.', 'Title: Convenient to store + update; Content: After researching both on-line and in stores, this was the ideal set of bowls. While of course they don\\'t go in the microwave, I can get by with only one glass bowl for that type of task. What these bowls do have going for them is that they go in the dishwasher, and most of all, each lid is color-coded to match its bowl. The bowls nest and the lids stack under them--a big space, time, and frustration saver. They do well in the dishwasher; so far the shiny interior has not gotten etched, and the lip does not collect as much water as other bowls I\\'ve had. I\\'m very pleased with this purchase. 1/7/19 Update: as other reviewers stated, not all the lids fit the bowls perfectly. Some do, but one lid is large enough that I wouldn\\'t store the bowl with juicy food in it on its side or turn it over. Another lid is small enough to need some \"persuasion\" to go on. I lowered the rating from 5 to 4 stars because this is not a deal breaker for me, and I would buy the set again. Typically I don\\'t store food in bowls, only as prep or for storing something I\\'ve made in the bowl and know will be eaten w/in 24 hours; most of us have tight-sealing food storage containers for leftovers and longer storage. I still love these bowls and am happy with the purchase.', 'Title: Compact storage, nice range of sizes; Content: Sturdy and convenient nesting bowls. Lids are secure once you \"burp\" them.

They come in a box, however the one I received was pretty beat up, but luckily the bowls were not damaged.

I got these to replace them and I\\'m so happy with them. Simple, good quality and I love that they are so colorful. If you bake a lot you will have the colors memorized in not time!

Everyone loves them who sees them when they come to my kitchen. The vibrant colors and the fact that they are all together and stay together making it almost impossible to loose them or misplace them. The stainless ring that holds them together is sturdy and rust free. This set is sturdy and will probably last longer than me. I love baking and this set makes it easier for me to measure my ingredients with out stopping and looking for measuring spoons and cups. The vibrant colors and shiny stainless steel makes baking fun.', \"Title: NO KITCHEN SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS!!!; Content: . What a cool surprise! Several features I have wished for through the years. They stay together, for one thing. There is an 1/8 tsp. (which I think is a pinch?) and not usually in a set and I can get into all my spice jars, tins, etc. Sometimes I need to pour into my hand and then measure or play guesstimate? Someone put it all together. And you can memorize the colors that you need to use most (like teaspoon and tablespoon) so you don't have to try and read small print, but it isn't even that small of a print so it is easy to see. Someone finally got wise to the program. These are smashing,\", \"Title: Every size you will ever need.; Content: I like both these products because of all the sizes. Many sets only have 4 basic sizes. Occasionally I see recipes with metric measurements. Now I can use my new measuring spoons for those also. The metal on the cups is a little tinny but I'm not using them for anything hefty. Love the magnet and colors for both products. These are easy to read unlike my old plastic ones where the sizes were the same color and the handle.\", 'Title: A perfect set!; Content: Perfect! This was exactly what I wanted and needed. I love the rainbow colors, which also helps me color-code measurements and not mistakenly use the wrong one. I also love the shape of the double spoons, plus the many more measurements offered and magnetized for easy storage. The slender-shape spoon easily fits into small spice bottles. Highly recommend.', \"Title: High Quality; Content: I was a little skeptical about spending this much on a measuring cup and spoon set. However, this is what my boyfriend wanted for Father's Day. I don't say this often, but he was right in selecting an amazing quality product. I love that these are magnetic and don't clutter the kitchen drawers. These are definitely worth spending a little more on for the fantastic quality.\", 'Title: Not bad.; Content: I like these because there are so many different measurements however the measuring spoons are all ready getting rusty after only a few uses/washes.', \"Title: Love this set; Content: I love this set. The measuring cups have more sizes than usual (I use the 2/3 cup for my oatmeal), nest perfectly and the handles are wide so that they are sturdy and easy to hold on to. This is very important to me because I have bad arthritis in my fingers and my hands have a tendency to tremble. The measuring spoons fit perfectly into spice jars. They have a lot of different sizes that you don't usually get with most measuring spoon sets. May not use the tiny set that measures a tad, dash and pinch, but they are there if you need them.\", 'Title: You get a lot for your money.; Content: Great deal for your money. The measuring cups are very pretty and shiny. They don’t get scratched up with use and being washed. I like that the cups are one solid piece of metal. No creases or lips that meet, so powders like flour, etc. don’t get caught in between them. Plus they haven’t rusted. The long gated measuring spoons are nice because the fit perfectly when you have to measure spices. And the added bonus are the cute mini measuring spoons for like a dash, a pinch, a drop, etc. They actually do come in handy. I would recommend them.', 'Title: LOVE THIS SET – GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE; Content: Was looking for a new stainless steel set of measuring cups and spoons and hit the jackpot with this one!

If you’re looking for a good measuring set – you can’t go wrong with this one!', \"Title: Quality is excellent; Content: Love this product and ordered it early for my granddaughters bridal shower. She loves to cook and bake so these are perfect. She's fussy about quality as I am also and these met the grade with me, sleek modern look as well and easy to pour and clean looking. The extra measuring spoons are a bonus and cool.........loved this and I know she will as well. Thank you for a great product.

Many of my measuring spoons have been broken, lost or borrowed. I have three partial sets... I love the weight, the silicone on the handles makes it easy to measure with wet hands or floured hands.

They don't take up any more room than my old ones with half as many cups and spoons.\", \"Title: Great tools; Content: These are great. I have a list on the inside of my cabinets so I know which color is what size but I'm starting to memorize them and won't need it for long. I love the unusual sizes in both the cups and spoons.

They arrived in a timely fashion and look exactly as they are advertised on Amazon. They are very sturdy. I love that I can use just the spoon I need and wash only that one spoon I used (instead of washing all of my plastic spoons when I used only one spoon as they are held together with a ring). They are always all together in my kitchen drawer with a strong magnet. And each spoon has a narrow end for spice jars and a round end for liquids. I like them so much I bought a second set for my daughter. She loves to bake and uses them daily. I can recommend this spoon set without reservation.', 'Title: Perfect. Highly recommend.; Content: I love these and use them daily. They are less clunky than ones attached with a ring. They are definitely the most used measuring spoons I have now. Being able to measure two different things with the same measurement without having to stop and clean it is great.', \"Title: Nice measurement set.; Content: 21 Pcs Stainless Steel Measuring Cups and Spoons Set, Wildone Stackable Metal Measuring Cups and Spoons for Cooking & Baking, Includes 7 Cups, 9 Spoons and 5 Mini Spoons（Black） I really like idea of this set, having off-sized measurements such as 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup, and the mini spoons are very handy! All of the sets fit together well, and have those cool little clips so the cups and spoons don't want to run around all over a drawer, and the sets are very efficient on space. The solid construction and stamped measurements are excellent features as well, ones that I look for and choose when I can. However, I noticed that the paint on the handles of some of the cups where they go on the clip is already starting to flake and chip. It's only very small areas, but it does give me pause to wonder how well the coating will hold up over time. Overall I like this set, and hope that they hold up with time and use.\", 'Title: The measurements I need!; Content: I wanted a set of measuring spoons and cups with a variety of measurements. This set fits the bill. I need to cut so many recipes in half and these measurements have those half-sizes. I ordered two sets. Love them. Recommend them to everyone who really cooks. The handle on the measuring cups might need to be a bit sturdier, but that is the only complaint I have and it would not prohibit me from purchasing them.', 'Title: Awesome Cupsand spoons set!; Content: I am so happy my measuring cups finally arrived!

Magnetic spoons are great with easy to read measurements. The cups are not easy to read. Good variety of measurements. Sturdy. No mention about suitability for use in dishwasher.', 'Title: If you cook, you need these!; Content: These measuring cups and measuring spoons are made of high quality steel. They are easy to read, easy to use, and easy to clean. The measurements on the cups are actually stamped (embossed) onto each handle, so they won’t disappear like the ink stamped ones do. The measuring spoons are magnetic and will stay together. The spoons are identified with different colored labels, and I say here that the actual measurements are inked onto the colored labels. The ink may eventually come off, but that is not a game changer for me. There are also additional sizes in each set. The cups also have 1/8 (2 tablespoons) and 1/16 (1 tablespoon). The spoons also have 3/4 teaspoon and 1/8 teaspoon (pinch). I will be using these from now on. This is a good measuring set combo that will last a long time. Highly recommended.', \"Title: Read the description of the size of the spoons. Several are repeated.. Dumb; Content: This is a great set. I don't know why they bother giving duplicate measuring spoons for several measurements. They're including mini spoons that are the same size as the next group for the most part. I didn't read the description enough but they make it seem like you're getting all these different sizes when three or four are repeated.\", \"Title: NOT ACCURATE MEASURING SPOONS; Content: I bought these as a gift and realize after I couldn't return them that these measuring spoons are NOT ACCURATE. The teaspoon is about a gram off of what it should be! If you are a true Baker or cook DON'T BUY THESE!

The names are wearing off the spoons already. Wouldn't buy again.\", 'Title: Spoons are good but writing fades off; Content: I just received these measuring spoons a few minutes ago. Unpacked, took a look, packed them back up. The idea of the spoons being magnetic is great. I also like that they are oval as well as round in case one needs to get something straight out of a spice container (i.e. the little Tupperware ones. But..... 2 of the spoons, even though unused and never being exposed to water, already show the measurement that is written on the colored plastic part fading off. I can only imagine what would happen after a few hand washes or even exposure to a dishwasher. So, while the spoons itself are great, one needs to be prepared to memorize what color plastic Mark is what size. I sure cannot do that. It would have been perfect if the measurement has been engraved instead of just printed onto the plastic. What a potty.', \"Title: Measurements were already scratching off when I received them!; Content: The measurements on the magnetic measuring spoons were already starting to scratch off from the friction of the magnets. Seller sent me a new set but the replacements had the exact same problem and then the seller didn't respond to me reaching out after that. Buy from somewhere else and find a set with etched measurements instead of these!\", 'Title: measurement/writing wears off fast.....; Content: the measurement/writing on spoons wears off very easy.... mine wore off in 5 months, and i never use them that much....', 'Title: Good Quality INITIALLY; Content: These measuring spoons are of excellent quality. I love the double sided feature where I can now fit the spoon into spice bottles without having to pour it all over the counter - and at the cost of spices - each grain saved is \"money in the bank\". Despite the magnetic ability to hold onto everything in the utensil drawer - the great advantage is that I can remove them as a single group and since many recipes require many sets of measurements using various spoons, I have them all ready to go, without having to go back to the drawer and search for a specific spoon for the next ingredient. The annotations are easy to read with the one exception of the spoon with yellow on white - which takes some squinting to read. But that is a minor inconvenience. So to sum it up - good quality, good price, and VERY convenient. UPDATE: I had ti change my rating from 5 to 3 stars because - after a few months of use the writing on several of the spoons which show the measurement have faded to a point where they can no longer be read. We have had to write up a separate card to link the color of the spoon to its size.', 'Title: A small flaw, great overall.; Content: I like this set a lot. However, I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the measurements are already wearing off after being washed so frequently. I find this to be a problem with a lot of manufactures when it comes to measuring spoons. If the measurements were etched on, these would be perfect!', \"Title: Very happy with the quality, appearance, and convenience. Love the mini spoons.; Content: I bought this set mostly for the mini spoons. I have been looking for a good quality set with actual numerical measurements on them: 1/64 tsp, 1/32 tsp, 1/16 tsp, …. The quaint 'olde-tymey' names mean nothing to me. There were only a few sets available that showed pictures with numbers on them but they looked like cheap aluminum, and worse, upon inquiry of the sellers I learned that the actual ones they were shipping did not have the numbers at all. Excuse me? After four inquiries to this seller–Wildone–I was able to verify that these spoons are made from 18/0 stainless steel and the numbers ARE on the mini spoons. I got the order in a day and was impressed with the quality. The spoons are all stamped magnetic stainless steel. The numerals on the mini spoons are cleanly stamped deeply and clearly enough for maximum legibility. The cheap ones of other sellers have very shallow barely legible numerals, if any. The color-coded plastic plaques on the larger spoons are OK and the numerals are large and contrast well with the colors, but after the first dishwasher wash, there is already some fading as others have mentioned. I won't do that again. The magnets are strong but not so strong that they are hard to separate. I fanned out the spoons to make it easier to take out the size I want. The mini spoons come on a split ring which makes it hard to separate them. The bowls get locked together and require a fingernail to separate them. So I added small magnets to them to make them as convenient as the large spoons. See images for details.\", 'Title: Works well except the writing rubs off...; Content: First, I have never scientifically tested if the portions are actually correct but from what I can tell they are accurate. They work great, the magnets keep it nice and tidy, and I love that there are two sides to each number (allows me twice the use / multiple ingredients especially if some are wet and some are dry). The main \"qualm\" I have is that the writing that tells you the measurement is starting to rub off! I\\'m not washing/scrubbing them excessively hard and I don\\'t often put them in the dishwasher. So I may have to write the measurements in Sharpie if it fades more... Other than that, they\\'re great for the price.', 'Title: They work; Content: I had a ragtag collection of measuring spoons leftover from previous sets. I was happy to get this set although I kept my old ones too. I like that there are two spoon heads on each size, one for liquids and one to get into spice jars. What would I do differently? I would have added a 2 tablespoon spoon and a 2 teaspoon spoon. I cook and bake a lot so that would have made these perfect. But honestly, they are fine and I am glad to have bought them.', \"Title: Exactly as expected; Content: These are a great set of measuring spoons. The volume seems accurate, and they don't oxidize in the dishwasher. I would recommend them. We had previously purchased some plastic ones, but they began to melt in the dishwasher over time.

But the quality is very poor.', \"Title: Mislabeled Measuring Spoons; Content: A lot of the measuring spoons are mislabeled as to what their size actually is. For me that wasn't a big deal, because I could figure out which was which. However, when my husband uses them he does what any normal person would and checks the label of the quantity. Overall, super sturdy, love the shape and heft. But disappointed by the mislabeling. Also, it kind of feels like you're a janitor with all of them on a single metal ring clanking about.\", 'Title: Good product for price; Content: These are decent measuring cups and spoons for the price. I was not expecting a culinary top of the line product for what I paid. I was expecting them to be labeled correctly. My 1/2 cup was labeled 1/4 cup.

But the spoons are kind of annoying in how thick the rubber part is, they don't lay well and it's rough to get off the metal wire that stores them together. The hole should be a tad larger , then it'd be fine.\", 'Title: The measuring cup handles Bend; Content: The measuring spoons are extremely sturdy. The measuring cup handles band where it meets the actual cup. A little disappointed that for steel.', 'Title: Mighty fine!; Content: They are not nimble and light but I didn’t want nimble. For serious cooks these will stand the rest of serious use and abuse. They clean up well and because the measuring cups ARE rather sturdy/heavy they don’t fall over if you set them down full of contents. The spoons are equally excellent and use. Again easy to clean and keep going. Both sets are now in almost constant use. The East to read measurements make quick work of glancing and cooking and moving quickly', 'Title: Extremely well made; Content: The cups are extremely well made. The reviewer that said the handles bend must have a different product than me because these have absolutely no give on the thick handles. The spoons have really complete measurements. The only thing is that the rings that hold them together are too thick to allow them to be used efficiently as they don’t slide easily. Also, there are too many cups and spoons to be easily used without taking them off the rings. All in all these are a great deal and well made. I’ll separate them and use thinner rings but they’re great.', 'Title: Nice but with reservations; Content: The handles are not sturdy enough. Need to be careful not to bend them. The size is not easy to read. Because of the straight sides to the cups, they are not as easy to separate, especially when you are in a hurry. BUT, the measuring spoons are great! Easy to separate, stay together in a drawer, love the extra sizes (eg. 1/2 Tablespoon) which are very convenient for when recipes are doubled or halved.', 'Title: Spoons are Great; Content: Love the measuring spoons. Not so much the measuring cups.

If I knew about these back then I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. The different colors are great for identification. They are easy to hold and easy to clean and sanitize. But my favorite feature is how the spoons are magnetic and stay together in the drawer! They even come with a leveler. I also like having 2 different shapes of spoon. Good for fitting into various containers.', 'Title: Overall Very good, minor flaws; Content: Overall, I love this set (so much so that I purchased some for family as well). However, I did add holes to the spoons so that they could be hung up on hooks along with the cups instead of on a magnetic bar. The only real downfall in the set- I would suggest to the manufacturer to change their leveler- it’s not level. It’s curved for look which is not entirely helpful while trying to accurately measure. Other than that it is a great set.', 'Title: Not heavy duty; Content: There is nothing good about this set of measuring cups and spoons. It’s supposed to be heavy duty which as you can see from one of the pictures it’s paper thin metal on the cups. The spoons are heavy duty but aren’t accurate. As you can see from the other picture the two 1/4 tsp spoons are very different sizes and when filled and poured into the other one are different volumes. So this whole set is just disappointing. At this price point I expect measuring cups that wouldn’t be bent right out of the box and measuring spoons that have accurate measurements.', 'Title: For the price, don’t hesitate!; Content: These are perfect! I hate buying measuring cups and spoons because they either bend, handles break off or they just don’t have all the measurements you want. This set covers them all! The spoons are thick metal. I don’t see me randomly bending them at all. The cups are one molded piece so no handles to break off. And there isn’t a measurement, that you’d need, that isn’t present in this set. They hang easily. Packaged nicely. Just get them already!!!', 'Title: Easy to read; Content: These cups feel heavy duty. I thought they were going to feel thin and cheap but the quality was way better than I thought. I like that the spoons have the sizes engraved it makes for long lasting easy reading.

I love the extra set of tiny amounts (dash, pinch, etc.); so cute. The quality is excellent. Stainless steel. Easy to clean. The markings are easy to read and I love that each cup has additional markings for additional measurements. For example, I can use one cup to measure 1/3 cup of oats and the same cup to measure 1/2 cup milk. Less to clean. Double duty. I love that the set includes a leveler and keep it handy for quick use.

They are dishwasher tolerant--I place on top shelf. My only qualms are the sturdiness factor and the ability as I age to read small print even with Rx glasses. One must take care not to bend the handle when dipping out flour or it could break. That being said, I am hard on utensils in the heat of creating and if handled with forethought, it probably won't be a problem. The alternative is a $50+ Williams & Sonoma set.

I've been using both sets a lot and the one thing I have started to notice is on the measuring cups where I use heavier ingredients and dip the cup in my contaoner, such as sugar they are bending where the handle meets the cups.

Really like the 2-sided measuring spoons, both for the option to use for spices and just having a 2nd spoon of the same size to measure with. Both the spoons and the cups have extra size(s) that most other sets don\\'t have for added value. Having the spoons hold together magnetically is much superior over the rings which I always found to be a pain. I especially like the long handles on the measuring cups-most sets I looked at had really short stubby handles which makes getting into canisters more difficult. My only \"complaint\" and its a tiny one, is the flat part of the leveler is too short for the larger cups. It should be completely level for an entire side. A better design would have one entire side level and the other curved out to allow for ease of holding.', 'Title: This set has everything you need.

Wish I had these years ago. Whether this is a gift, or for yourself, consider giving the best! There are 5 things that makes these stand out from the rest. 1. There are more graduations on both the cups and spoons. 2. The measuring spoons are not only double ended, but one of the ends is oblong to fit into the spice jars. The double end is also convenient when you need to measure multiple spices of same amount. 3. The spoons are strong magnetic and they stay together well & don’t get lost in the drawer. 4. The set is well marked, and colorful. The measuring cups come on a big ring, from which they can easily be removed. 5. Sturdy stainless steel, quality made.', 'Title: GREAT set of measuring cups and spoons; Content: LOVE this set of measuring cups and spoons. I have had several sets of plastic ones over the years and finally decided I wanted to buy a nice set. I’m so glad I did! Probably my favorite feature of this set is that the measuring spoons are double-ended. Having the narrow end is great for some of those small spice jars. The measurements are etched into the cups so it’s easy to read and won’t wear off. The measurements on the spoons are printed but are holding up well so far, and I run them through the dishwasher. I like the variety of measurements on both. I could do with or without the leveler - because of the angles it isn’t useful for the measuring cups. I took the cups off the ring due to my drawer depth - they stack nicely. Love that the spoons are magnetic. I’m very happy with this set and would highly recommend them.', \"Title: This is a great measuring set all around.; Content: These are great! The measuring cups have the size stamped in the metal. The measuring spoons are magnetic and have two different sizes of scoops depending on what size your jar opening is. I removed the ring that holds the cups together. It's too bulky when they are all together and why wash more than what you use. I bought my daughter and both my daughter in laws a set. Love them!!\", \"Title: This is a nice combination of measure cups and spoons; Content: These have become my goto measuring spoons. The color coding makes it easier to find the right spoon if you do a lot of baking like I do because you begin to remember which color is which size. I didn't really think I would use the cups a lot, but it turns out they are very handy. I have only one objection, but it is still a 5 star purchase.

It is not big enough to cover the larger sizes.\", 'Title: A QUALITY SET OF MEASURING TOOLS; Content: I looked forever for the most comprehensive, matching, quality-made set of measuring cups and spoons — that would fit into spice jars — and these TOTALLY fit the bill. I was skeptical about some negative reviews stating poor finish, rust spots, etc, but honestly haven’t seen one thing wrong with my set. Everything from the metal gauge to the stamped / engraved labels is top notch.

Having the option of an oval or a circular spoon helps a lot when you have to dip into a narrow spice jar. I hope eventually I will memorize the colors for the size, because the labeling is not always easy to read without my glasses.', 'Title: Close but no cigar; Content: This is an updated review. As seen below, when I received these I thought the material looked to be \"reasonably solid\". However, I just used the one cup measure for maybe the 2nd or 3rd time and as I went to wash it I noticed that the side is cracked and bowed out (almost like a little pouring indentation). So that one is going in the trash. Disappointing. I\\'ve never had this kind of problem with any other measuring cups. I have other metal measuring cups but the sizes are hard to read so that is why I bought these. Fortunately I still have the old one. The material seems reasonably solid. Two major reasons I orders were the shape of the measuring spoons and the color coding. Now that I have them I will use (some of) them. But I won\\'t be ordering them as a Christmas gift for my sons, which had been the plan. The reasons are as follows: 1. While the size is engraved on each handle, it\\'s smaller and harder to see than I had hoped. 2. Labeling is not consistent. The 1/2 Tablespoon is written as 1/2 tbsp. Typically (and on other Tablespoon spoons in the set) the T is capitalized for tablespoons so I found this to be confusing. 3. The biggest problem is actually the color coding that had attracted me in the first place. This is accomplished through a silicone insert that adds substantially to the thickness of the handle. This makes nesting impossible and even trying to manipulate around the ring very difficult. Fortunately the silicone insert is easy to remove, which is exactly what I have done for the measuring spoons. When taken out there is a nice big oval so they fit on a ring and are easily handled to get to the one I want. I took the cup measurers off the ring and pulled out the sizes I use most often. Maybe I\\'ll find a use for all the other sizes someday but at this point I feel that the extra sizes did more for increasing the cost than for helping me cook. Bottom line: I will use these but they don\\'t provide the ease of use I was hoping for so I don\\'t recommend them.', 'Title: Perfect imho; Content: This is the measuring CUP & SPOON set I have been looking for! Buy the RECTANGULAR set instead of the ROUND set...The rectangular ones are all narrow & can easily fit into spice jars whereas in the round set the measuring spoon part gets wider & wider & won’t fit into many slim jars. I’v had solid metal sets before but when baking/cooking I now prefer a more substantial handle. Love the super soft & smooth silicone handles..great for giving a good grip while baking. Absolutely love the variety of colors. Very vibrant colors...can easily grab your 1Tbsp spoon quickly once you get familiar w/the colors. Comes w a bonus leveler & mini (super small!) whisk which was nice. Both sets came zip tied & in plastic bags & looked new.

I really love the rectangular shape of the spoons since they fit into spice jars, salt container etc. as opposed to the traditional round shape.

This set will probably outlive me!\", 'Title: Great design for usability and lasting use; Content: Measures on the cups etched/stamped into the metal so they won’t fade or get scraped off and leave you guessing. Handle covers prevent them getting hot when measuring hot foods (like for serving portions) Measuring spoons, even the tablespoon, will fit into a spice bottle due to their shape. Makes it a lot easier than trying to pour the spice into the spoon.']\n",

I somehow lost one of the spoons from my previous set of measuring spoons, so I ordered these as a replacement. The two-sides feature is so useful. It’s great to have a skinny spoon to fit in spice jars, but I’ve found that it’s also incredibly useful to have two of the same measurement for recipes that have both wet and dry ingredients of the same measurement. I was a little skeptical/unsure of the magnetic middle, but I’ve really enjoyed this feature. It’s so much easier than trying to thread spoons back onto a ring. **note that there is a 1/2 Tablespoon measurement. I’ve never had that spoon, and I hadn’t noticed it in the bunch.

I like these very much due to the smaller units. The narrow end of the spoon is supposed to easily go into a spice bottle. I had some issues with that. But I managed and things worked out ok. I used a smaller spoon to dip out into the correct sized spoon. The magnetics are great for putting them all into a place of storage.

I initially purchased them for our RV but ended up swapping them with the set I had in the house. Increments go all the way down to 1/16 of a cup. No more guessing how much 1/8 cup is or Googling how many tablespoons / teaspoons it takes to get 1/8 or 1/16 of a cup. The measuring spoons have a dry and wet version and are magnetized to keep them together. That doesn't always work especially when in a drawer that doesn't have quite enough room. Overall I like this set and would recommend them.\", \"Title: I love this set!; Content: The magnetic spoons stay together neatly in the drawer, unlike any other set I've had. It's also helpful to have the additional options. I chose not to hang the measuring cups, but if I had a good place, I would. I've always wished to have more options in a set, and this one delivered! Sturdy, easy to wash and store.\", 'Title: Love the dual scoops!; Content: This is a great set with a wide array of sizes and dual scoops! The only challenge I have had is when you grab one, you grab them all! The magnets in the handles are pretty strong and it is sometimes a nuisance.', 'Title: Nice set but a bit messy; Content: These are very nice measuring spoons especially since they have the double ends with a narrow spoon on one end to get into small openings. The magnets holding them together are sort of weak, they come apart in the drawer plus they want to attach to everything else in the drawer or sink.', \"Title: Compact organized measuring spoons.; Content: Very satisfying to have a set that keeps itself in one place so I don't have to hunt the drawer for random measuring spoons. Very happy with this set and recommend it to anyone needing organization and space saving items.\", 'Title: Wonderful-magnitized & says together in drawer; Content: LOVE THESE SPOONS! The set come with the \"pinch, dash\" spoons. During Quarantine Co-19 & all our baking, another set of spoons come in handy. The untit is magnetized & stays together as a unit in the drawer. Wonderful set.', \"Title: So many sizes, and they don't get lost in the drawer; Content: I bought a set of these spoons for my daughter and one for me. I love that it has unusual measures like 1/2 tablespoon and 1/16 teaspoon. The magnets keep them from getting separated and lost in the drawer. The colors on the handles make them easy to see if half of them take off on a side trip. The leveler is a nice addition. They are sturdy and seem like they will last a long time.\", 'Title: Sturdy magnet so they stay together in the drawer; Content: I love every feature of these spoons. I’m too through with my old measuring spoons and digging for the right spoon size because they are not connected, or washing the whole set after using just one spoon because they are connected. These have a sturdy magnet so they stay together in the drawer. Double sided is so convenient and I love the level tool. I have bought 4 more sets as gifts.', \"Title: They keep the drawer tidy; Content: Love these measuring spoons! I like how they nest and don't spew all over the drawer. Makes them easier to find. My other loose measure spoons are attracted to them also, which is no big deal. The long end makes it so much easier to stick inside a spice tin and pull out leveled. I'd recommend them. I hand wash them. Easy to clean, too.\", \"Title: Bulkiness outweighs usefulness; Content: I was attracted to these pieces because of the unique measurement increments and shapes. But they are so bulky that they dominate my utensil drawer and the clutter is frustrating. I found the measurements on the spoons and cups themselves difficult to read (and I'm not that old). While they seemed like a good idea, they ultimately weren't very useful.\", 'Title: Convenient set overall.; Content: Spoon set magnets are a little weaker than another set I purchased from a different Amazon vender.

Not only are they beautiful but everything I've cooked on them has turned out lovely. I haven't seen any color changes. The food doesn't stick. Cookies come out beautifully!

They slightly overlap when using 2 of these sheets at a time; just a little, but i still like them. I baked at 400°F and broiled for about 2.5 min on low on toppest rack and they did not warp or anything. I used parchment paper as a lining under grid rack. The only negetive things that I could think of for these is that for some reason, there are these slightly brownish spots that won't come out when cleaning. Even after scrubbing with a sponge gently with baking soda and soap(minus 1 star for that). I've mostly used enamel baking sheets in past so this is new to me, not sure why this happened...too high temperature..? Also, I think the bottom of the sheet got scratched a little from the metal to metal contact when I was pulling it out of the oven... I'll still keep them though as it took me a lot of time and effort to find these specific kind that are NOT nonstick and NOT aluminum. Great size too if you have a family.\", \"Title: Time Will Tell; Content: They aren't heavyweight or flimsy. I think the mirror finish will probably scratch easily. I've only used them once and nothing was burned or stuck. They are definitely worth the price. Update: I see a lot of reviews about warping in the oven and I've NEVER experienced that. I've only baked at 350F for cookies, frozen garlic bread and pizza. Perhaps try reducing the temp? The mirror finish is still holding up and cleanup is easy. For those who have issues cleaning these. Just use parchment paper or soak them a bit. I use vinegar and dish detergent on all my SS cookware.

They fit, but I wouldn’t buy them again and suggest you pass on these...', \"Title: A Great Addition to Any Kitchen!; Content: My wife and I have wanted a wire rack and baking sheet set for years but, for some reason, just never purchased it. We took a cooking class recently that lit a fire to finally purchase a set. The value of this set surprised us and we immediately purchased it. This set is amazing. We had a wire rack for baking, but it was large and didn't fit in the dishwasher so we would rarely use it because it was a pain to wash by hand and make sure everything was off the wire. This set is a perfect size to fit in the dishwasher and the refrigerator so we have used them many times already, even in instances where we wouldn't actually need their full functionality but just because we now owned them. Coming in a two pack is great. Two sets give you the ability to put raw meat, say freshly out of a marinade or breading, on one rack to wait for cooking while you can use the other rack for the cooked meat without having to wash in between. The pans easily nest inside of each other so two pans barely take up more space than one. These pans and racks have changed the way we work around our kitchen so much that we're not quite sure how we lived without them so long. We highly recommend them! One clarification I would like to add is: I would actually rate the durability as a 5 with an * by it. Everything is solid stainless steel so durability is 5/5. BUT. Everything is solid stainless steel. That means the 4 legs of the stainless steel wire rack will scratch the pan. It was a little sad to see the scratches start to form on the pans and take away from their bright & shiny luster, but the pans are solid stainless steel so it's not a coating that is being scratched off and the pans retain 100% of their 5/5 integrity and usefulness.\", 'Title: Good buy; Content: Great. Very happy with these. The racks clean nicely in the top level of dishwasher. The pans can be easily cleaned with SOS pads under running water.

Not the best pans I could have gotten but they do get the job done. I should have paid a little more for better pans. But these will do for now.', \"Title: Very nice quality; Content: I like these baking sheets. They are sturdy and easy to clean. I bought them for my husband who enjoys cooking but he learned real quick that you need to use a cooking spray on them to prevent sticking. No big deal though.

Used them one time baked potatoes at 475 degrees. Some of the silicone adhered to the bottom of the pan. That means some of the silicone adhered to our food! I did not find the liner easy to wipe clean. It took some scrubbing and left stains even though baked pototoes are not particulary messy. Disappointed.', 'Title: One out of two worth buying.; Content: Honestly disappointing pans. I went for stainless steel because I bake at high temps and I don’t want a pan that warps. It does. The liners are great! I recommend them.', 'Title: Easier to clean than regular pans; Content: I never before tried a washable rubber or silicon baking sheet liner and I like it. It makes baking and cleaning up a lot easier. It spares the pan underneath the liner from getting so dirty so fast like my past baking sheets that didn’t have liners. I would use parchment paper on the pans before but despite the parchment the pan itself would get such a burnt finish. I’m hoping the rubber or silicon liner keeps the pan shiny longer.', \"Title: Great Set! Baking times need watching; Content: We unboxed these and put them to work right away as we have been feeding thanksgiving family guests this weekend. I was super excited and after washing off the silpats and trays we set to baking meringues and cookies. I was a little amazed at how much shipping material was used to package this. Each tray and silpat was lined in plastic...it felt wasteful. No sticking issues with either of our baked products; but one caveat and I dropped a star for this...we had to add a few minutes to each recipe because the pans are thicker than our usual baking set. I think the gauge is thicker, so just be sure to watch carefully and don't rely exclusively on recommended bake times in your recipe book. Maybe this could be offset by convection.\", 'Title: Heavy, sturdy, quality pans; Content: All of a sudden I realized my baking sheets were OLD non-stick coated and in bad condition.

Highly recommend.', \"Title: I use these all the time; Content: The pans are sturdy and easy to clean. The silicone mat is also easy to clean. I try to be more environmentally friendly in the kitchen and I love that I'm not using so much parchment paper all the time now.

I have to really scrub to get the stuck part off of the pan. I have learned to spray them before cooking.

The small silicone liners have been helpful although juices still run into the corners. I've started using Pam cooking spray on them before I use them so that cleanup is easier. When under the broiler there is that inevitable crack sound when the aluminum gets too hot and the pan buckles.

These were all a bit smaller than I thought they would be, with the smallest one being toaster oven size. They're beautiful pans when you receive them, and they've held up relatively well through a few bakings. Yes, they warp at high heat but if you think a $30 set of plans isn't going to warp, you probably need to do more research. I don't believe these are true stainless steel and for this price, I didn't expect them to be. Any grease or oil on the pans is going to stain them. If that's a huge deal, you'll want to line the pans. If you want to take the chance, you can always use baking soda to remove the buildup. I gave them 4 stars because they seem pretty durable, and for what I was expecting they work okay.. but I did deduct a star since they stain so much easier than I expected them to.\", \"Title: they're ok; Content: For the price they are adequate. 3 star quality, plus 1 for the price. basically 10 dollars a pan. They are a bit thin, they do scratch easily, and warp some at 400 degrees. of course the more weight you have on them the less they warp. They get the job done though. I bought mainly because I wanted to cook on stainless steel and not aluminum or any other possibly toxic material. I use a plastic scratch pad and dish soap to hand wash. you can also use baking soda with a little bit of water to make a paste that helps get some of the baked on stuff that wont scrub off with dish soap.

This makes for easy clean-up. They haven't warped in the oven, although they haven't been subjected to more than 375° F. It's too soon to know if the cooling racks are actually stainless steel instead of chromed steel wire, but I like that they're a grid pattern instead of just straight wires.

Whilst in the open position, I pried slightly apart what I can to have the fluid sloshing inside the lid to get out, and then air dried the lids for over 24 hours as there is a gap in between the seals.

We have opened bags of this and that all over our pantry. I thought by having these containers which are opaque would make it easy to see what is inside plus help cut down on the clutter of the pantry. The tall containers are perfect for pastas and cereals. I really like the tight fit and seal that each container gets. Overall I am pretty impressed with this set. I would recommend it to others. I feel that it is a pretty good deal for how many containers you get. I would consider ordering more.', 'Title: Great containers for organization; Content: I have been looking for containers to organize my pantry and was so excited to find these. They are a great quality. I love that they come in a range of sizes and also have labels.

I kept seeing people complain about separating them from each other for the first time. My advice, put on the side and pull one side, turn to next side and pull and keep going around. I put a little muscle in it but I'm 70 so it didn't take much muscle and just a little patience. The containers are very sturdy and the lids seal tight. The labels are a bonus for being able to see what's in them. Some of mine went in pull out shelves in my cabinets base. I put the labels on top of the lid and can see what is in each container.

Once you get them and take them all apart, you realize what a big supply of containers this is! The plastic is flexible and seems sturdy. You get snap-on lids for them – one size fits all. This is a really useful set, and could be utilized to store all kinds of other things as well, from hobby supplies to arts and crafts. The price of $47 is not inexpensive, but then, you’re getting a big pack. In fact, that’s less than 2 dollars per container. You also get black labels and a white pen.', 'Title: 5 stars!; Content: Just spent a lovely day reorganizing my pantry after receiving this set of storage containers. The containers are great - varying in sizes, with lids that snap on just right, cute chalkboard labels. I literally have nothing to complain except I wish the company offered options to purchase single containers of every size, because I need a few more, but have no use for another 24-piece set.

However, one of the lids broke today after 10 months of having them. I open this container maybe 5x a week and they aren’t subjected to any heat or cold, so I expected them to last longer. If I were reviewing them last week I would give 5 stars but since only 3/4 are still still usable, downgrading to 3 stars.', 'Title: Read the product description before purchase!; Content: I failed to thoroughly read the description, so I was a bit upset over the size of the containers. The two larger containers were perfect for flour and sugar. The smaller containers I was planning to use for cereal but they are way too small. So I found other uses for the smal containers; dry beans, powder sugar, brown sugar, and piloncillo(mexcian brown sugar). My search for a good cereal container remains but overall I am quite pleased with these and will probably order more to store other dry goods. Such as bulk goods I get from the grocery store(pasta, rice, candy, ect). The lids seal tightly, however I am concerned over cleaned with the rubber seal. I will try to update if I remember after a few cleanings.', 'Title: Hardly anything comes out.; Content: I was so excited to order these but was a beey disappointed after using them the first time. I purchased these containers for cereal and to create a uniform pantry. While they are visually pleasing, they’re basically useless. It’s so hard, almost impossible to pour cereal from, even Cheerios and Fruity Pebbles. Don’t even attempt it with Shredded Wheat cereals or Cap’n Crunch. I have to constantly shake it around to get anything but we’re to the point now that we just take the lids completely off. Kinda ridiculous and I shouldn’t have to do that. Lol The price is nice, in theory, but invest a little extra for better designed containers. The material is nice, sturdy and keeps the cereal fresh. They’ll probably last quite some time though I may use them for baking ingredients or pasta shells. They’re pretty tiny also. They’ll only hold smaller boxes of cereal...that oversight is purely my fault though as the description does state the specifications. Overall, I would NOT recommend this product.', \"Title: Decent; Content: These are decent. They seal well enough, and snap to unlock, so that's nice. But the opening doesn't allow for bigger cereals to pour well without getting clogged. Also would be better if the pour opening were flush with the side rather than having a little dam for the last bits of stuff to get caught on. But it depends what you put in it. I've only tried cereal so far.\", 'Title: Unsure; Content: I like the way these seal and wash up, but it’s hard to pour the cereal out. I think the holes are to small to pour our a descent amount. My husband hates them.', 'Title: 100% recommended; Content: My nice love them and so do I they are perfect for the cereals but also to store homemade soups on the fridge. It makes it easy to pour a portion on the bowl to reheat in the microwave. Now with the COVID 19 I cook more at home this makes easy to store pourable stuff like soup and creams. Thank you so much I will definitely recommend and buy it again.', 'Title: Pretty but not really functional; Content: I had high hopes for these containers but they are not working out as well as I thought they would. They are hard to seal on, it’s almost as if the lid is too small. Also, when I pour cereal or snacks out, it is hard for the food to come out and hard to control the amount that comes out. It also leaves residue and crumbs on the small lid before I close it which is annoying. I have two starts since they look pretty but not super functional.', \"Title: Not ideal for pouring cereal; Content: These containers are build well and lock nicely... BUT Not ideal if you plan on using for cereal. The opening is too small and my cereal won't pour out (lucky charms or cinnamon toast crunch). They are also bulky\", \"Title: Look nice, air tight, impossible to pour from the lid.; Content: These are OK. Definitely is a nice air tight seal. I bought these for cereal containers and they do hold a good amount of cereal. But, the pop open lid doesn't really allow you to pour out the contents. I have another brand I use for backing supplies that works great with pouring, so I'll either swap them, or just buy more of those. Taking the whole lid off every time you want something is just a bit too annoying.\", \"Title: very sturdy and air-tight, but the mouth is not large enough for most cereal; Content: bought these for storing cereal. The containers themselves are well made and have a fantastic seal. The issue I have is that the mouth of the lid is too small and cereal doesn't easily pour out. This is true for small cereal like lucky charms, but even worse with something like shredded wheat. Might work great for small grains like rice or beans or something, but doesn't work as good for cereal.\", 'Title: Keeps cereal crispy-fresh; Content: Keeps cereal crispy even in humid weather. A little cumbersome to get lids on and off but the seals are well designed and keep things dry and fresh.', 'Title: Love love love these!; Content: I was in search of some containers that would keep our cereal fresh and keep tje sugar ants out. I looked into the OXO brand but was not willing to pay the hefty price. I had some OXO push pop containers a while back and the lids would slowly slide off when you held the container by the lid (no bueno for what they cost). I wanted something affordable that would make my pantry look organized and pretty and came across these containers. I decided to give them a try and Im so glad i did. The lids snap close and the opening to pour cereal onto your bowl is sealed tightly (you have to use a little force to open it). Our cereal has stayed fresh and i love that im able to see when we are running low. I have been very satisfied with this purchase', \"Title: Great containers, they are good quality and you get a decent amount of them.; Content: I bought these to keep pantry moths out of my cereal while I battle for ownership of my house with them, it looks like these are going to do the trick. The seals are real snug it's definitely air tight and it's not difficult to open the pour spout but it definitely takes some pressure so it seals good aswell. I was able to fit a whole brand new box of Honeycomb cereal in one so it's capable of holding any average size box of cereal no problem. The plastic isn't super rigid it has some bend but doesn't feel super cheap it also has a nice clean look. For the price this is a really good amount of a really decent product.\", 'Title: I absolutely love these containers; Content: I have purchase a few different storage containers in my day but was looking for ones specifically for cereal and came across these, and they work better than i thought they would have to be honest, the latch and seal around the top of the container really are air tight along with another set i recently purchased i filled these up with some water to test them as i was rinsing them out for the first time and they held water, the other amazing thing is the lid on top for pouring the cereal out of is just as tight and well fitted as the main seal, the little raised latch is also a nice feature i was worried that if i hit these just right a container would just pop open but that is not the case, overall i would highly recommend these storage containers they work wonderfully and come as advertised, they will fit most family sized boxes of cereal, but good luck if you buy the bags, dont think you will get even 3/4 of that in one of these, also if it is bigger like mini wheats they will not fit either so you have to buy the smaller boxes.', 'Title: Super Convenient, Keeps cereal way fresher than the bag; Content: I really like the how these keep cereal fresh. I don’t eat cereal often so it often goes stale in the bag in my pantry for weeks. These are way easier to pour and put away than trying to use bag clips. They fit a whole bag of the big boxes of cereal from the store. The spout is a little to small for cereals like Cinnamon toast crunch that gets stuck, but otherwise works great. I found the stickers kind of pointless because everyone knows what cereal looks like.', 'Title: Happy so far!; Content: Bought to store cereals for freshness and easy access. Seem to seal well and pour spout lids close tightly. Happy so far! Will have to wait to see about durability and freshness, but they seem tough enough after already being dropped and beat up a little by some curious cats.', 'Title: A year later…still great!; Content: I’ve had these containers for over a year and they have held up great. They’ve only gone through the dishwasher a few times. We normally just rinse them out, dry and add new cereal. For the most part, every BOX of cereal I buy, fits in the container. Big bags of cereal do not always all fit. They have a nice seal and keep everything fresh.', \"Title: These seal so well that I can barely get it open; Content: These do EXACTLY what they're intended for; to keep the product inside fresh. We LOVE these, great for cereal, cookies and crackers! Oh and the amount of labels that come are more than enough for when you need to change them out!\", \"Title: Great packaging. Not so functional seal; Content: It came with great packaging both bubble wrap and in one of the most sturdiest boxes I have seen. Everything seemed of quality when I removed the containers from the bubble wrap and washed it before use. It was not until I put honey oatmeal squares in one of the containers did I encounter an issue. For it to be airtight and sealed I should not have been able to smell the cereal from outside the container, yet I did. We have an ant issue from the summer heat and neighbors moving out removing their source of food from them to us, causing me to purchase these containers. They aren't as air tight or scent tight as I had hoped thus making it not a great value for what you pay for. If what you store inside is not sweet or a concern this is a decent deal. Another note worth mentioning is when you wash the lids water gets trapped inside a hollow space inside, the mechanism that allows the container to seal and unseal with the lever. Allocating some funds to aid in bettering the seal would help.\", 'Title: Great for its price; Content: These containers are great instore flour and such in some and also cereal and pasta in the other with no issues.', 'Title: Seal very well, but makes them hard to open. Big box of cereal does not fit.; Content: Pros: Very sturdy and the lid will NOT come off. Shorter, if you have fixed shelves than some other containers. They seal really, really well. I sent them through dishwasher with no issues. Even when pouring heavy (rice) foods, the lid is secure and will not pop off. Labels and pen are nice. Cons: These are smaller than I expected. The big size boxes of cereal (like from membership stores) will not fit. I have some Rubbermaid ones that are 1.5 gallons (sort of oval shaped) that are about the same quality, larger and cost less. Because the hole is sort of indented in the top, cereal (especially small stuff, like oatmeal) tends to get stuck in the indentation. The little lever for pulling up the lid to access the food is too short, it can be hard to pry open. This led to cereal being thrown all over when a kid was struggling with opening. If you have any sort of hand issues they will be hard to open. These are expensive for the quality.', \"Title: Wonderful for preventing spills and keeping things fresh.; Content: I had been using cheep generic storage containers previously so these are a big step up! I had to raise the shelf in my baking cupboard to fit them but it was worth it. No more spilled flour all over! The Good: The large size works well for 5lbs bags of flour, sugar, or rice (it takes about 7.5lbs of rice to fill up a container). The lit and the pour spout both have a gasket around it to help keep in freshness. One end of the containers are indented making it easy to hold it. I placed the labels on this end since that was the side facing out of the cupboards. These are great for storing smaller bulk foods. Think rice, beans, and puffed rice or corn cereal. The bad: The spout is set back in the lid so it isn't possible to easily fully empty the container without removing the lid. It also means with larger cereal (corn flakes) it is easy for them to get caught in the opening. Overall these are wonderful for preventing spills and keeping things fresh.\", 'Title: I believe I have purchased these before; Content: We store dry goods in plastic containers, that can be well-sealed to prevent any spoilage or bugs. I also put my bird seed in the containers to make sure the seed stays fresh and bug free. Sometimes, getting the top to seal properly, I have had to open the lid, attach it to the base and then close the lid. It works for me. And my husband loves putting his cereals in the plastic containers. He wants to see an entire line of plastic containers. I think he has gotten his wish.', 'Title: Great for Cereal; Content: These close and seal super tight. I love the labels and paint markers. You can put the date on the label so you know when its bad. They are a little hard to open at first, but after a while they are easier. Also comes with one scoop', 'Title: Perfect for the pantry; Content: We use these for cereal, sugar, flour, rice, etc. They are well made and seal perfectly.

However, since these are advertised as containers for dry goods, I assumed 175oz would be the equivalent of almost 11 lbs. So, was expecting them to easily hold the 10 lbs of grain I was planning on storing in them...they only ended up holding a little more than half of that. Then I noticed on the bottom of the container that it is actually 175 fluid ounces. Not really sure why you would advertise a product for dry goods in fluid ounces...', 'Title: Perfect Fit For 5lb of Grain; Content: I bought a set of these to store some bulk brewing grain. I have found that the 5.2l version perfectly fit 5lbs of several different brewing grains. As you can see in the picures, roasted Barley fits with about an inch to spare. Flaked oats (oatmeal) is a tighter fit with less than a 1/2 inch of extra space. If you are looking for a different size, in my experience a good rule of thumb is 1lb of grain per liter of space.', \"Title: Very small; Content: As mentioned in a review I read this morning ( my fiancé ordered these, not me ), these are advertised in fluid ounces not dry ounces and that makes a big difference. Easiest way to describe that: compare the size of a regular can of soda (which is 12 fluid ounces) and a regular can of Pringles (which is 5.5 ounces). I don't know many types of people who would store fluids in these types of containers. But I must be honest and remind you that all storage containers are measured in quarts or gallons though we use them for dry merchandise such as clothing or blankets. I don't yet believe these actually save us space since we are using multiple containers for one product (such as coffee and rice) that were in larger containers previously. They seem to be airtight, they do have a thick rubber seal in the lid. Thick plastic containers though I will wait to see how long the locking clasps last. I will of course update if needed as time goes by\", \"Title: Awesome Storage Containers; Content: These things are great. They're solid plastic and seal tight. I use these for all my sugar, salt, coffee beans, and all sorts of things. The labels are well made and make it easy to sort. The seller even included an extra lid and extra labels, which was nice of them. Some people are a little confused on the sizing. They hold 1.6L which is 54 fluid ounces. Fluid ounces is a volume, ounces is a weight. These aren't huge containers that will hold a mega-family sized box of cereal in one. I would describe them as a medium sized container.\", \"Title: Perfect for 1 to 2lbs bags of dry goods; Content: I LOVE these! Other reviews mentioned that they are small.

I would recommend using both hands to grab a container if you have something heavier like flour in it. From the product pictures they look like they are clear plastic. I should have looked at review pictures cause they are actually very slightly frosted. It’s bot a big enough deal for me, but it does cheapen the look a bit.

Be careful how much pressure you apply to close them, or you'll crack the covers.\", 'Title: Got what I was looking for; Content: These are great overall.

I put soapy water in them and fastened the lid and when I shook them no water came out anywhere. They took me probably five minutes to clean. They dry really fast. In the picture I have stored 4 pounds of rice, 7 pounds of powdered sugar, and 7 1/2 pounds of brown sugar. They aren’t quite as translucent as I thought they were going to be but they still look very good. They come with multiple labels, which I thought was awesome. And they also come with to one cup measuring cups. I haven’t quite found a use for the fourth one yet but I know when I need to put something in it it will hold very well.', \"Title: Love at First Organized Pantry; Content: We LOVE these containers. I was so sick of every organization method I tried failing because as organized as I was... the methods just didn't work for me. I wanted simple, clean, easy to use, organization that would keep food safe and that I didn't need to buy tons of add-ons to maximize space in my small kitchen. I got these as a gift, loved them so much I bought 4 more sets and am ready to buy more... because I don't just use them for food storage anymore. You can literally use these for everything! I've got a set under my sink presently holding extra walnut sponges, extra dishwasher pods, extra magic erasers, and one that holds all the things I use to make my homemade carpet cleaning solution makng my life so much easier. These are great and really versatile! I have no regrets and no remorse purchasing. I'm actually looking forward to purchasing more to help organize our laundry room and to further organize and declutter our kitchen. Where were these before I spent all that money on silliness before?\", \"Title: Does not take up much space.

Had considered ordering another set until I found the broken one.\", 'Title: Great storage containers at a very reasonable price.; Content: These containers are airtight, easy to clean (even the gasket in the lid comes out easily), and they stack nicely. They hold more than they look like they will hold. They were packaged well with thin plastic bags separating the containers as they come nested into each other. Each lid is contained in its own thin plastic bag. The lids were a little stiff at first but just gently bent the flaps down a couple of times and they were fine after that. Very happy with this purchase and my pantry looks amazing too!', 'Title: Very small capacity storage containers; Content: The website description and picture make these containers seem much larger than they really are!

I can't put my sugar or cereal or flour in them and I don't buy large size items. If you are looking for smaller containers for storage they are great but for larger items look elsewhere.\", 'Title: So-so storage; Content: I was a bit bummed to find out the largest size didn’t even fit a full box of cereal. I wanted to get organized and these helped but not as much as I had hoped.

I have tested the airtight while washing and having dish soap/ water held upside down and it didn’t even leak. Happy with my purchase and bought one for a friend too!', 'Title: Not that functional - better options available; Content: I would not recommend these containers for the following reasons: - These are too narrow for a 1 cup measuring cup. If you are looking to use these to store baking ingredients, I recommend getting containers with wider dimensions. - For storing cereals, grains, I prefer containers that have a lid that allows you to pour the food out of the containers without having to take to whole lid off and potentially make a mess. Though these are high quality, there are better options that are more functional and convenient to use.', 'Title: Perfect size for organizing my kitchen shelf; Content: I bought these to help organize my kitchen \"baking shelf\", where I keep all my baking items, such as various flours (coconut, almond, tapioca), chocolate chips, and other larger quantity items, and they look great on my shelf. They fit height wise, just right but depth wise the shelf is wider so I also bought (Airtight Food Storage Containers - Wildone Cereal & Dry Food Storage Container Set of 16 [1.6L /1.5qt]) to use in front of these. They are the same thing but a smaller version. Between the two, I will have my shelves organized so I can see and find things quickly without having to search around a mess of small container and bags of stuff so old (because I can\\'t find them when I need them) that they have to be trashed. I am loving the look of my organized shelves. They all seem to be functioning as I would expect and the lids fit just right. I\\'m am happy with my purchases.', 'Title: So many uses!; Content: Our pantry is really my houses catchall! We don’t have anywhere else in the house to store anything. It used to be our utility room with random crap pilled into it. I found some scrap wood and built a much needed pantry to get everything off the floor. These little containers are the best! The absolute perfect size. A way to contain the chaos! I can see exactly what I have so we don’t over buy. I even put my house tools and thing in the extras I had. I bought two sets of these after seeing how perfectly they worked for us! Definitely recommend this product! I didn’t use the labels because well, I can see what’s in the containers already lol. I did cut out the labels and nutrition facts for my rice and just added into the container itself. Yes my room is full, but I know where everything is and I can easily access it all!! I’m just a regular mom who bought something I think others people could use! Great price! I didn’t get a discount or anything for this review. I have sent the link for these to my invite family!', \"Title: Very tall; Content: I love these containers ! Living in an RV we try to keep the bugs etc out of our pantry and these do the trick. ( not that I have a bug issue, just trying to keep it that way ) My only issue with these are they're tall, I can't stack them, but can sit them side by side with some smaller ones I bought that are stackable. It makes my pantry very organized. Forget using the stickers that come with them, things are always changing, as to what your storing in them, and you end up with empty ones waiting to be filled with the same item you had in it before. cereal is about the only thing that stays the same, as does spaghetti. I find myself using them on a as needed basis, and always have something stored in all of them regardless of what was in them before. Yes...I'd buy them again, and have ! You get your money's worth and I can't see them wearing out from usage.\", 'Title: Perfect!; Content: If you’ve got a kitchen with tons of spices, lentils, flours, etc...this will be perfect for you. I’ve ordered 4 sets of these already. Extremely pleased with how much they hold (will hold a 4lb bag of lentils) and how easily they stack in the pantry. I’ve got a smaller pantry and these containers are helpful in optimizing the storage space.', 'Title: Great containers; Content: I really love them. I purchased 2 sizes, the ones on top are their large 4L (I used them for cereal, granola, oats, and rice) and the ones on the bottom are the 2.5L (I used them for sugar, brown sugar, powder sugar, flour, chia seeds, and cacao) Both sizes are very useful. They came in perfect condition, looks like they will last long. They just look awesome. I should’ve taken a before and after pictures. I still need to add the labels', \"Title: Good value but didn't meet all my expectations.; Content: These are the containers that I had the correct height for on my pantry shelf. They will only hold a regular box or bag. When I received them I was disappointed that they were not as clear as depicted and the bases are smaller and rounded so they cannot be stacked side by side tightly.\", 'Title: Love it.; Content: Love these bins! Bought several of them to completely reorganize my pantry. They stack nicely and it’s super easy to see what’s in them. My only two complaints are the seals on the cereal pour spouts are easily plugged with cereal, especially if you use a smaller cereal, such as granolas. It works great for flakey type cereals and they don’t tend to get plugged. For my granola, I just open the lid instead. My other complaint is that there is a lot of wasted space. If the edges of the containers were more square, you could fit more. I’m have more space than before, so this is somewhat of a moot point, but I would still like to see a better use of space. Overall, I love them and will be ordering more.', 'Title: Perfect for the job; Content: I needed to reorganize my kitchen cupboards from round containers that were not space effective to square and rectangle containers that could be stacked and would take up less room. The Wildone 5 Pieces Airtight Cereal Storage Containers were perfect for what I needed.', 'Title: Really good storage containers; Content: I love that this set has a variety of sizes, I used them for coffee, beans and ground herb storage. Just what I needed at a good price. The quality of the containers is really good too. The only hassle is when you wash the lid the water takes forever to drain from inside it, but otherwise no complaints, they stack pretty well in my pantry.', 'Title: Great containers; Content: Smaller than I thought they would be but they work great on my sugar, pasta, flour, etc.', \"Title: Great for the price; Content: There are thicker plastic containers on the market but there is also much thinner ones also. They will do nicely and last a long time with proper care. Remember the lids have a removable seal. Knowing that will help with cleaning and drying them. I used 3 of the biggest for plastic cutlery. They will hold 100 of each: forks, spoons and knives. They come with chalkboard stickers and a marker. I used the stickers but not the marker. A big one will hold 16 boil-in-bag rice bags. I haven't used any of the smaller ones yet. I would estimate they would probably hold about 6 to 8 sticks of butter. But I can't say that for certain because I have not used them yet.\", 'Title: Pantry organization; Content: This is my favorite set of new storage containers were my favorite, and I should have ordered another set. Anywho, I operate a small, home-based baking business, but very little storage space. My ingredients are safe in these air-tight containers. I used a separate set of larger chalk labels for these square containers. I would definitely recommend this set.', \"Title: Great containers; Content: These are very cool and useful containers. They have good latches and seals. Th y don't take a lot of space but are large enough to store food in and stack. I recommend these containers to anyone thinking of buying.\", 'Title: Great for (finally) getting my pantry organized!; Content: These containers are great! My pantry is never super organized so I was a bit skeptical about how much I’d use these, but they’re great. The kids are easy to snap on, the sizes work well for standard quantities of pasta/pretzels/etc, and they stack easily on top of each other. The instructions suggest hand washing the lids but I put them through the top rack of the dishwasher without any issues. I do wish there were more large containers vs small since we needed the largest sizes for things like a small bag of veggie straws, but overall this set is a nice value and works really well!', 'Title: great item; Content: This is a great item! It has 24 pcs of container. In the container, you can keep things like snacks, food and e.t.c. It can fit a lot of amount of food and has a lot of space. It is airtight storage. I recommend buyers to buy this item.', 'Title: Excellent storage. Wish there was a measuring scoop for every container.; Content: My pantry is obnoxiously narrow and I was looking for some containers to help organize it. These fit the bill almost perfectly! PROS: + REALLY tight seal! Keeps things fresh and prevents spillage. + You can take the whole top off or just open the pour spout. + There are measurement lines, so you can see at a glance how many cups of flour (or whatever) you have left. + Write-on labels. - The back is tapered for an easier grip when pouring. + A measuring scoop is included. CONS: - Only one measuring scoop. I would like one for each container because not all of my measuring cups fit inside as well as theirs does. - A bit awkward to snap the lids on BOTTOM LINE: Practically perfect', 'Title: Storage for a variety of pantry items; Content: I like the versatility of this set. They can contain pantry goods such as cereal, dried pasta, beans, sugar, flour, hard candy and just about anything that is dry and pourable. The seals appear airtight, and the pouring opening is easy to manage. The snap-on lids are a little difficult to get in place however, and may be problematic for someone with arthritis or little strength in their hands. It would also be good to include individual scoops for each unit. The labels and marker are a nice bonus.', \"Title: Well made and just the right size; Content: We're always looking for ways to organize our kitchen cupboards and to make better use of storage space, so these six containers are welcome. We're using them for sugar, flour, rice, Splenda, bran flakes and generic Cheerios. The containers are just the right size -- they hold enough to be useful, but they're not so large as to be a problem fitting into cupboards. The tops are easy to get on -- you just clamp all four sides of the top to the base and you're done; from then on, your just open the pour spout on top to get to the contents inside. The tops and the pour spouts are all ringed in a rubbery silicone so that the contents are sealed in once the top is in place. It's good to be able to see how much of the contents we have left so we don't run out. We really like these and are happy to have them.\", 'Title: Great Organzational Tool for Your Pantry; Content: Fantastic storage items. If you want to get your pantry organized, these are the ticket. They stack easily, they clean easily, they are made of a durable plastic that held up in the wash and the tops click down with effieciency. I’m really impressed with these. I also love that they come with chalk labels, and a pen! That’s an extra little bit of niceness in the package. Plus, the extra labels in case you mess up. Overall, very satisfied with this product.

So I’ve become extremely paranoid about eating food out of the pantry. I couldn’t find them in any of my food but after cleaning out my cabinets I will no longer eat anything that wasn’t stored in the an airtight container. This meant I suddenly needed A LOT of containers. These worked out PERFECTLY. I’m not currently using all of them which means when I come back form the store, I have a few handy! I wanted some that were dishwasher safe because hand washing them after they were emptied would become annoying pretty quickly given how many containers I’m using. Overall, I’m very happy with these. Plus the market is about 1000 times better than the one that came with my older containers. It writes a lot thinner so I can more easily include the product name and expiration on the label. The one thin that does annoy me that no one has seemed to figure out yet with these kinds of containers is that the bulk of the lid and shape of the container takes up more room than necessary when they’re side by side. A lot of wasted space between containers when your cabinet area is small. (Check what I mean in the pictures)', 'Title: River Critters! No Admission!; Content: This was just right for us!

They're worthless. Threw them out, along with about $10 of sugar. Grrrrrrrr, I really like this set of 6 large food containers from Wildone. Each holds 16.9 cups, which is enough for a standard bag of flour or sugar (standard supermarket size, not large box retailer). It comes with a set of chalkboard stickers and a marker. I am also impressed by how they were packaged. Two stacks of three containers, nestled within one another, and flipped, to economize the amount of space needed in the box. The tops were in one stack, the stickers, pen and scoop in another. Very good use of space and a nice thing to see in today's climate. The one thing I don't like about this set is that it comes with one scoop. Either you have to keep the scoop out, and clean of sugar, or you have to remember which container it is in and move the containers around to get at it. The tops are really better for pouring, which means they are more ideal for cereal, rice, etc. You really can't use the pouring spouts for baking because it will come out too fast. That said, I put labels on each, filled them and now I feel super organized and efficient. You can too!\"]\n",

I have bought other sizes that match them for a well-appointed pantry, and it all looks really good!', \"Title: Good Quality; Content: I really like these containers. They are nice looking and seem to be very sturdy. I was looking for containers that would fit entire boxes of pasta so I wouldn't have to store them in the original boxes and they would look nice in the pantry, and I was not disappointed. Of course, what fits into one container largely depends on the type of pasta. Here's what I found out when I went to fill them. Entire normal size boxes of Ziti, Penne, Rotelle, Shells (Great Value brand which does not specify a size but they look to be about medium), and GV bowties all fit into one container nicely. Also, I fit a 13 oz. box of potato flakes into one container. Depending on the shape of the pasta, some have a little bit of head space while others fill them completely. I was able to fit almost an entire 2 pound box of macaroni into one container. On the other hand, I could only get about half a pound bag or so of wide egg noodles into one container. I will probably look for something larger for those kinds of things or maybe just use two containers. I hope that helps anyone who wants to store things like that. I hadn't seen anything like that in the reviews I read so I had to just guess at the size based on a container I had at home that was approximately the same size. Bottom line, it depends on what you want to store in them and what your expectations are. They are pretty much the perfect size for my needs. I only gave four stars because I haven't had them long enough to really know how they will hold up but they seem very sturdy. I like the fact that they are sheer enough to see what you have in them even without the labels. The labels are really cute and an added bonus. I do agree with others that the blue ink doesn't show up. It's really too bad because the pen has a nice point on it which makes it very easy to write on smaller labels. I've been wanting a chalk marker with that fine a point but haven't ever been able to find one.

I haven’t washed any containers after putting the labels on them, so I can’t say for sure how long they’d stick after a wash, but the labels seem like they’ll hold up really well even with a few washes (and since they’re storage containers, you won’t be washing them as frequently as regular dishes). I’ve gently wiped the chalk off a few as I’ve made changes to my labeling, and the water from that hasn’t loosened the stickers at all.

They nest perfectly, and you really only need these?', \"Title: Very good bowl set, dishwasher safe, marked inside for rough measurement.; Content: A lot of uses for a good bowl set. I make a lot of pancakes and waffles and make too much batter, and this is a good way to store it in the fridge. It helps initially with the water level for a big batch, then the bowl is nice for whisking in the mix. finally the unused batter can be preserved with an airtight lid to keep it fresher. The lid helps keep the rising quality of the buttermilk batter intact for much longer so the next time I use it, no flat lifeless pancakes. There are many sizes each useful in it's own way. I make cakes, cornbread, homemade soups and stews, tosses salads and mimic a local restaurants dish called a chop salad. As a single, I need to keep the contents sometimes for a few days, especially with things like my tuna salad, made with eggs, tuna, mayo, relish, shredded cheese, and chopped celery. I need it to last about three days and with the airtight lid it's fresh on the third day. Having convenient bowls to use with the whisk is good, scrambled eggs become fluffy, and can be easily made into nice omelets. The bowls themselves are interlocking for storage as are the lids, I can keep them in one place on my prep table. They are dishwasher safe, although I'd hand wash the lids. The bottom is silicon so it's harder to just knock them off the table by mistake. When I do juicing, I can use these as some storage containers to prevent some fruits and veggies from going bad too fast, or just to store them after cutting and cleaning. When I make my slow cooked marinated steaks and chicken, I can leave these in an airtight bowl for up to two days in the fridge for the tenderous meat ever. I love these, recommended.\", 'Title: Compact, durable and versatile; Content: Mixing bowl sets are the way to go to maximize your options and storage space. Previously I had a mishmash of plastic and glass bowls that didn’t stack together and wasted space. What’s great about this set besides all fitting inside each other and coming in a range of sizes are the little design “extras”. Lids so you can store leftovers, cover while marinating or proofing dough. Also useful in proofing dough are measurements inside the bowl so you can measure if a dough has doubled, or use when adding ingredients. Nonslip bottoms mean the bowls stay put while mixing, but if I had to ding this for anything this also prevents them from being used as a double boiler or if you need to chill the bowl with an ice bath. Overall though it’s a good set in a range of useful sizes with helpful features.', \"Title: Only mixing bowls you'll ever need; Content: I have limited cabinet space so I love having products that stack together to save space. This set of mixing bowls not only saves space but it is all you ever need for mixing and storing. You get six graduated sizes of bowls from tiny to large. Each bowl has a silicone bottom so that it doesn't slip and slide around on your counter when you are mixing. Each bowl also has a snap on plastic lid so you use them for storage as well. These bowls are a nice heavy stainless steel that washes up perfectly every time. I have been really impressed with the quality and versatility of this bowl set and if you need new mixing bowls or need to buy a gift for a newlywed, this would be perfect. Highly recommended.\", \"Title: I love these bowls; Content: I realize these bowls are expensive but I still just love them so much that I can deal with that. They all fit together easily making storage easy. They have lids so you can save food easily in fridge. I think it is a stretch to call the lids airtight, as they don't stay on that well, but they work for my purpose which is to keep food good in the fridge. They have little things so you can measure things AS YOU PUT IT IN THE BOWL (brilliant). I wish they had cup marks on the inside and not just liters and quarts, but I guess it isn't that much of a big deal. Also note that you cannot use a mixer with them - the mixer scratches the metal. So they are best for hand mixing or serving or storage, but not for baking where you need your mixer.

Fraudulent claim re my prior review.', \"Title: Pretty, Solid, but Stains Easy; Content: If it weren't my stupid fault for not checking measurements, I'd drop these to a 3, but since I didn't actually verify the size, I'm taking responsibility here. First, the mirror finish is very nice! That is, until you cook with them once. Even putting foil down didn't prevent the biggest one from getting a little grease on it. I have-washed it and it came out cloudy, and the second time was in the dishwasher, still little imperfections started forming from just not getting it clean enough. Maybe I need jet dry, which I'm absolutely terrified if after an incident over a decade ago in which I had a drop of that stuff fly up onto my cheek. The racks are all perfect fits to their pans, and the smallest one is actually a perfect fit for my toaster oven! Great replacement for the cheap aluminum garbage that comes with toaster ovens. Particularly when you use the rack. Still doesn't leave enough space for a mini pizza, but that's virtually impossible since the toaster itself is just big enough. Honestly these would get a 5 if they weren't such a massive pain to keep clean and shiny! I worked as a dishwasher at a high-volume buffet and we had some stainless sheet pans that looked shiny again after a hand wash to get the crud off, let alone after going into the high-heat dishwasher. It's not a huge problem but part of the appeal is the mirror finish on these, and I can't see that lasting very long with how easily these get scuffed, stained, and otherwise made imperfect. Great build quality otherwise though. They're sufficiently heavy to indicate being steel, no weird issues with the extrusion or rolling, just overall well-made, but don't expect the big guy there to be a full half-sheet pan. It's good for a small roast or even bacon (seriously try making bacon with the rack, it's a thing of beauty), but it's very limiting for, say, cookies.\", 'Title: Wonderful!; Content: I am really impressed with these little pans. I bought them to bake bacon. I liked that each pan has its own wire tray. I find the trays to be sturdy and am finding I use all of them way more than I thought I would. I can place fried foods on the smallest one and leave in a warm oven while finishing cooking other parts of the meal, and all stays crunchy. At high temps (broiling, which is above the temp recommended for this pan set) I have heard the biggest one “pop”, but upon cooling, it returns to flat. Other reviews complain about difficulty cleaning, but I have found the opposite. I find that no matter how much stuff appears to be crusted on the pan, a little dishwashing liquid, and a soak in hot water (just fill the pan), place the crusty tray upside down in the hot water, and about ten minutes later, super easy to wash away, almost like nonstick surface. I have been shocked and pleased. They come out of my dishwasher looking shiny and bright when I run them through there. (We do have a water softener, so complaints that they lose their pretty finish may be due to hard water or different ph than what we have?) but honestly they are so easy to wash by hand with a short soak, I generally just let them drip dry after, and all good. I would highly recommend these pans.']\n",

My biggest problem though is if you use it for Life or Cinnamon Toast Crunch they do not pour out of the little hole so my son has to take the lid off completely. This was supposed to make things easier. Going to buy some larger ones with bigger holes for those cereals.', 'Title: SMALL read the measurements AND REVIEWS; Content: Ummm…No way this fits a regular sized cereal box or 85.4oz … I won’t even attempt.

I didn’t pay much attention to the dimensions when I ordered, but these are much smaller than I anticipated. They only hold about 1/3 a box of cereal. I didn’t think the lids were as secure as soon other brands we owned, so I ultimately returned in favor of a larger and taller container.', 'Title: NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR CEREAL; Content: They take up more space than I thought and can’t hold a box of cereal but they are well made', 'Title: Small than expected; Content: These are smaller than expected so that was a bummer.

Other reviewers stated they were large enough for a family box cereal and that is not true. You will need 2 containers for 1 box of cereal. I would have purchased different containers if I knew this. Another thing is the hole in which the cereal pours from is very small and makes alot of work out of pouring cereal when it shouldnt be.', \"Title: Really good but...; Content: They're really good but way smaller than expected.

I always review everything to death but I didn’t on these, I wish I did. We are a family of six, and I need two of these containers to fit the medium size bags of cereal. Definitely won’t fit a big box. Gonna have to look for bigger and use these for pancake mix and such.', 'Title: Not for family size cereal boxes; Content: Will fit an average size cereal box but not big enough for the larger family size cereal boxes.', 'Title: Large family approved!; Content: I am beyond pleased with these containers! We are a family of 6, with 4 of those being children so we buy a lot of cereal in massive boxes.

I just love it and the material is really good. They so strong', 'Title: Seals Tightly, Maybe a Wee Bit Smaller Than Expected; Content: I like these a lot, but if you are expecting to use them for cereal, I hope you buy the small boxes. My 16 ounce Dr. Pepper bottle is almost taller then they are. That is their only drawback. They look cute in the pantry, and they seal tightly. The pour spouts are great for rice and pasta. I would buy them again, but I question whether they really do fit a family sized box of cereal. My cheerios box says it has 20 cups in it, which is a bit bigger than the 16.9 these claim to hold.']\n",

So the whole 16 sets gives you 3 full boxes of cereal,I think the way to use these are like if you have alot of stuff in small increments like cookies,pasta,sliced fruit or cereal ..keep in mind these small ones for sure don't have a spout so you have to open all the four corners at once, but it still beats my kids throwing out one whole box to make there cereal versus a chunk of it,but I still have to help them pour out cereal or I'd be nervous.i put my containers on the microwave so kids can reach them also because I have to tall of kitchen shelves and hardly no table space.my small microwave only let's me cover about 8 or 10 on top ( in2 rows)4+4 and 2 on top.. if I put some on top ,but it works I guess.\", \"Title: Not as hard to unpack as people make it sound; Content: I bought this because my 12 month old thinks it's hilarious to dump out boxes of cereal. The containers are airtight and durable enough to withstand his attempts to make my kitchen a floor buffet of cereal, and they make great impromptu drums! They are easy enough to open that my 4 year old can serve herself cereal, which is great considering that I have to chase around the 12 month old as he figures out new hijinks now that cereal liberation is off the table. When first opening the product I was forewarned about the difficulty in separating the containers, but it really isn't as hard as some of the raters said. Simply put your fingers on each side of the container and pull the bottom container slightly outward to release suction. Then they easily slip apart.\", 'Title: VERY SMALL....; Content: They said these were for cereal, but the even small cereals like coco pebbles does not come out of the hole they put in the top of the lid to pour it from. We always just have to remove the complete lid to pour the cereal. Also want to warn you about the size. They are short which is one of the reasons I ordered these. I wanted to be able to put our cereal in a kitchen draw, but the \"cereal\" size containers are so little, even a small size box of cereal will not all fit in the container. You still have a small potion left in the bags that you then have to deal with. They do come with a black chalk board sticker that you can place anywhere on the container, but the chalk pen they send is a dark blue which does not show up well on the black. It does stay well; in fact I had to take a damp paper towel to wipe it off, to change the name. Unfortunately it leave a faint copy of the word on the sticker, so I know eventually this will not do well... Hope this helps!', \"Title: Pretty good; Content: I really like the feel of these- they feel thick and durable. I like that they sent extra labels and a marker, but the marker tends to smudge really easily every time my kids use them. These are a bit smaller than I thought, but a normal box of cereal fits in it. The holes in the top seem big enough but cereal is almost impossible to get to pour out of the hole without assistance. We have Life cereal, Honey Bunches of oats and Cheerios, and I have to stick my fingers inside to help get the cereal to come out. I feel like this could be fixed with some design troubleshooting. Overall they look nice and I like them, but if they could send a marker that's a bit more permanent and fix the top hole, it would be a really great product.\", 'Title: The perfect size for cereal; Content: It took me forever to finally pick these. I wanted to make sure they were big enough to fit cereal in them, and more than one box at a time. Your average size cereal box will fit in here filling it up about 3/4 of the way. The family size will fill it up perfectly. But then you have cereals like honey bunches of oats that come in pretty skinny boxes. It took 2 of those to fill up a container. These came with labels and the chalk marker. I think that part made me the happiest. My chalk markers were all dried out and the one that came in the set wrote perfectly and dried really fast. These sealed completely on all 4 sides and snapped down easily. The spout seals nicely also and is easy to open. Depending on the size of the cereal will determine how easily your cereal is going to pour out. Trix poured out nicely but the Chex mix was a struggle. They kept blocking the hole and getting stuck so I had to shake and pour, worked like a charm. I am very happy with these. I would recommend them.', 'Title: Works great; Content: At first, I was kind of hesistant to like this product. It is difficult to get it closed and to open it. I have to do it for my 6 year old. BUT it has kept the mice out (we live in the country and despite 2 cats, we still have to deal with the occasional mouse in the home). It has also kept the bugs out (again country life.) it’s an air tight seal so you no longer have to worry about stale cereal because one of your house people didn’t roll up the bag and close the box. The size is great. It fits a family box of cereal just fine if not stopping right at the top. The Costco boxes seem to be a bit too big because you can’t fit all of that cereal nicely into one of these. It also looks a lot neater having these vs a bunch of random opened cereal boxes crowding your counter top.', 'Title: Child friendly; Content: Bought these to make fixing cereal for my 9 year old easier. She loves these. They fit on the lower shelves in my pantry unlike regular cereal boxes and she can pour cereal easily without making a mess. They keep the cereal fresh as well. Easy clean up tip I put the entire bag of cereal down in the container instead of pouring it in.']\n",

The teaspoons are the size of tablespoons. The fork handles on the regular forks are extremely long.

They look kind of ridiculous and my younger kids avoid them. My almost teenager said he likes them for cold cereal. I use them more for serving spoons. I like the feel and weight of these. My old set had heavy handles and would tip over a light bowl. This set is not like that but still feels sturdy.

Would recommend.\", 'Title: Great items for taller folks; Content: If you are looking for utensils for the \"giant\" in your family, these are it. I got these to supplement a set I already had and sadly these are completely different so didn\\'t quite fit the bill. The largest spoon (soup spoon) is huge. It is the exact size of my serving spoon from a older set and the dinner fork tines are as long as my pinky. This would not be an issue but I am 5 ft 3 and everything except my fat fingers are rather small, short and stubby so this fork would probably do me some damage. The smaller salad fork is the same size as my regular dinner fork from another set. I am not saying this is a bad set it is just not meant for petite people. My 6\\' 3\" brother in law would, however, feel much more comfortable with this set. It is beautifully made and a bit heavy so great quality which is why I rate a 5 regardless of my inability to use 1/2 of the set.', 'Title: Beautiful and sturdy; Content: I was looking for a replacement for our old mismatched silverware but I wanted something different. I bought both the black set and the copper set. They are both great! It feels great in the hand not cheap or flimsy. The finished has held up nicely. My husband washes his cereal spoon right after eating every day. I got both so if can be mixed and matched for special occasions and be really unique. I love how large the salad forks are and my husband likes the large spoons. Mind you, the big fork and spoons are larger than normal and the small is just smaller than your average large. Even our daughter likes the new silverware. The butter knives can really cut, you can see the serrated edge.', 'Title: Thick heavy cutlery; Content: I needed spoons because mine walked away... the spoons are bit large but will work.

I don’t recommend.', 'Title: Spoons and forks are HUGE; Content: They are fucken massive good cutlery for a giant.', \"Title: Good enough; Content: Lots of pieces for the money, but the teaspoons are huge and the tabkespoons are the size of cooking spoons. No way a person with an average sized mouth could enjoy cereal or soup using one of these spoons. If you can do better, do better. If it's all you can afford, it'll make do\", \"Title: Great set. But large spoon is huge.; Content: Really sturdy quality set. Looks nice and feels nice. It's just as other reviews say, the spoons are huge. I often serve food with the large spoon and use the small spoon as a regular spoon for eating and soup. This may not end up being my forever set. But it will do for now! Great value.\", \"Title: Fine. Tiny forks. Sharp knives.; Content: So these are fine, stainless, fine in dishwasher. Dirt cheap so I bought a 2nd set to solve my fork problem (see below). I like the sharp knives. Don't need to have separate steak knives now (well idk haven't tried it on actual steak yet but fine for chicken). The forks are not Lg and Sm. They're Sm and Tiny. The one they call a salad fork is about the size of a shrimp cocktail fork just with 4 tines. The one they call large is what I would call a salad fork. I thought I'd be fine with having 8 total forks, whatever I'll use small ones no prob, but I had to get a 2nd set because 4 of the forks (the tiny ones) are nearly useless. So, now I will have 8 salad forks. Which I'm fine with, not a huge fan of big forks anyway. The knife handle is great. The rest of the handles are not like that. They're not rounded on the edges, and are a 90degree corner. Not quite sharp but not smooth. They need to file those down. Whatever. I'd have gotten a $20 set from the start if I knew about the forks. Not gonna bother returning (unpacked and washed and tossed everything already before I noticed), that's why I decided to just get another set. But all in all this isn't that upsetting. They're durable - I don't think the spoons will bend when you're scooping Ice Cream or anything. And they don't look like they have a cheap plating on them. For $10 they're fine.\"]\n",

The one disappointment was the stiffness of the lids. They fit well, but I would have preferred a bit more flexible material. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase.\n",
            "\t Title: Fantastic Bowls; Content: Do I ever LOVE this bowl set!!!!!! Super happy I bought these. Bowls are nice and big, fitting lids and I like how you can slice or grate cheese from the top of the big bowl right into it. Definitely would recommend these to the man/woman of the kitchen!!!!\n",
            "\t Title: Good bowls, but loose tops; Content: Bowls are great in size and stackability, the rubber bottom helps it grip the surface it is on, the only drawback is that some of the lids are not tight sealed and can pop off or become loose, so you have to place another item on the top to keep it down. But I have used and cleaned all the bowls and lids and they are great especially since i got my Smoker grill and have a lot of leftovers and or need to season or add sauce!!\n",

            "\t Title: These Are Made With Quality; Content: If you have ever struggled to keep your bowl steady on the counter while using a mixer then you will appreciate the rubber bottom on these bowls. 3 other things I really like about these bowls is: 1. They are stackable - perfect when space saving is a neccisity 2. They each have their own lid - makes it perfect for storing leftovers 3. A nice variety of sizes - 1.2Q to 5Q An added bonus is the how colorful they are.\n",
            "\t Title: The bowls are great, the lids not so much.; Content: We wanted this set for the rubber base - non slip and really stable. The bowls are decently heavy duty and easy to clean. The lids were a nice addition, but had nothing to do with us getting these. Good thing. Out of all the bowls, only two of the lids actually fit well and stay on. The rest are either too warped, too small, or are not deep enough to stay closed. The smallest one was all three of those. The lids have more of a plastic feel than rubber. The bases of the bowls are rubbery and really grippy, plus they have ridges. The fact that they nest is great, and they are dishwasher safe. A nice bonus is the scale makes inside all but the smallest bowl. Markings are in liters and quarts. Adding cups would have been a nice addition, but converting is not that difficult. Bowls - 5 stars. Lids - 3 stars.\n",
            "\t Title: Simple The Best Mixing Bowls Ever! Beautiful Stainless, Non-Slip Bottom & Lids!; Content: I have owned may different types of bowls over 55 years of cooking and baking. This Wildone set is the best ever! The bowls are very well designed with a beautiful polished interior including measurement makings etched into the finish. The silicone bottoms holds the bowl nicely in place and keeps the stainless steel from scratching anything. Lids! No more wasting plastic wrap to cover the bowls. Having the measurement markings makes it so much easier to make recipes together. All in all this is a fantastic deal on what I believe is the best bowl set on the market. I truly love these! Of course I could give it nothing short of a FULL FIVE Star rating.\n",

            "\t Title: I Love These Bowls!; Content: I needed a new set of mixing bowls, and I figured, bowls are bowls. Wrong! These bowls have some fantastic features that totally set them apart from run of the mill bowls. First there's the rubber coating on the bottom, which keeps them from slipping on the counter. Then there's the measurement guide on the inside of each bowl, so you can see the quantity of your ingredients. Then there's the great fit of the lids. Then there's the ability to insert grating discs into the center of the largest bowl cover (I haven't actually tried this feature yet). I couldn't be happier with this wonderful find!\n",

            "\t Title: AWESOME Mixing Bowls; Content: I LOVE these bowls. We previously had mismatched mixing bowls of glass and plastic that took up tons of space, but those are all out the window now that we have these! There are 6 different sized bowls in this set from 1 - 5 QT, so you've got tons of options depending on the sizing you need for mixing or storage. They all nest together perfectly which is super convenient as they hardly take up any space. The bowls themselves are really well made and look fantastic too. The stainless steel looks high quality and durable. They have a black, silicone bottom that helps keep them in place and makes them non marring on the bottom. The lids themselves are durable plastic that should last a long time, but they're hand wash only and there's a warning they may warp in the dishwasher, so make sure to hand wash the lids only. The bowls themselves though are dishwasher safe which is nice. With so many bowls and different sizes they're a really versatile set that should fulfill any mixing bowl/storage bowl need you may have. There are measurement markings inside the bowls as well which is really handy when dealing with specific proportions for baking or for liquids. The bowls looks so nice that we often put them out on the table filled with veggies, crackers, dips, etc. and always get compliments on how nice the bowls are. This is just a really great set that can eliminate a lot of bulky, mismatched bowls that are already in your kitchen collection. Highly recommend.\n",
            "\t Title: A fantastic set of stainless steel mixing bowls; Content: I really love this set of nesting stainless steel bowls. Stainless steel bowls are my favorite because, you never have to worry about breaking one, plus they're super easy to clean. The various sizes of these bowls is also great. The largest one is great for making a cake, and the smallest is perfect for whipping up a few eggs. I also love how the bottom of the bowls are coated with rubber, so they hold a bit better to the countertop. The only thing that I do not like about these bowls is the lids. The lids are just rubber inserts, but the problem is, they came slightly mishaped, so they don't fit into the bowls very well. Hopefully over time they will go back to a round shape, and this problem will go away.... Overall they are great bowls, and I use them daily in my kitchen.\n",
            "\t Title: Good Set of Durable Mixing Bowls; Content: These mixing bowls are really nice. I really like that they're nesting, so it cuts down on the amount of storage space needed. They're durable, they look good, and are simply easy to clean. The only thing I'm careful about is if I need to marinade with these bowls. If I use lime or any other citrus juice, I try not to use these. Only because you should use a non-reactive material if you're going to marinate with acidic citrus juices when cooking. Otherwise, these are pretty good. I recommend them to anyone who needs a good set of nesting mixing bowls.\n",
